	<path>/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/nes/10-Yard Fight (Japan) (Rev 1).zip</path>
	<name>10 Yard Fight [Japan]</name>
	<desc>10-Yard Fight is a simple arcade game based on American football. One player can play against the computer or a second player head-to-head matchup and can choose between five levels of difficulty (high school, college, pro, playoffs, and Super Bowl). If you win a game at a lower difficulty level, the following game is automatically played at the next highest difficulty level.

Gameplay is top-down and vertical-scrolling. There are no plays or formations to select from before the action begins; the player can take the snap as quarterback or choose one of two players on defense. On offense, the player can either keep the ball on the run, toss it to one of the two running backs, or throw long to the receiver; an interception turns the ball over to the other team. If a touchdown can't be scored, then the directional kicking system can be used to punt the ball or try for a field goal. One game consists (accelerated real-time) 30-minute halves of play to decide who wins this 10-Yard Fight.</desc>

	<desc>1991 Du Ma Racing is a horse racing game offering two game modes. 

In race mode, two players can compete in a race. By pressing a button at the right time, they can build up their horse's power, then press another button to release it and give their horse an edge in the race. The player who does this faster and more accurately will have a better chance of winning the race.

In gamble mode, 1 to 6 players start out with 500 credits to place bets on 5 horses. The race will be simulated without any player interaction, and at the end of each race event players will get their respective prize money. The goal is to earn more money this way than any other player.</desc>

	<name>1999 Hore, Mitakotoka! Seikimatsu [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Four Japanese high-school students were camping at the countryside, when they suddenly saw an UFO landing nearby. Before they managed to understand anything, a small pink alien with a strict-looking face came out of the space ship and announced that the end of the century is near - and something extraordinary will happen in the year 1999.

That's where the game begins. You can play as one (or two, in 2-player mode) of the students, competing against the others. You must prepare for the upcoming end of the century, earn enough money, and generally manage your life well. This is a Monopoly-like board game, only instead of dices you use cards. The characters are represented by small cars on a city map. The number that appears on the card you pull from the deck represents the amount of squares your car can move on the map. Each square leads to a different event: accident, romantic meeting, promotion, etc. Some of the events allow you to make an additional choice. For example, if you land in a casino, you'll be asked if you want to gamble. Answering "yes" will lead to a slot machine mini-game.</desc>

	<name>Street Fighter 2010 [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The player is Ken, the hero of the Street Fighter series. It's been 25 years since he last participated in a fighting tournament. He has become a scientist and has developed a powerful medicine together with his friend Troy. But an unknown fiend breaks into his laboratory, kills Troy, and steals the invention. It's time to recall the good old days and to embark on a quest for revenge!

Despite the US title, the game has little to do with the Street Fighter or the Final Fight games. This is an action platformer in which the player navigates Ken around, trying to avoid or kill the enemies by shooting at them with ranged weapons, adjusting the direction of the shot, or kicking and punching them. Ken is very agile and can jump high and climb walls.

The first ever platform adventure for the Mario Brothers has the player exploring level after level, with Bowser to contend with as the end of level boss. Power-ups include the Super Mushroom, which increases Mario's size and power, the fire flower, allowing him to shoot fireballs at enemies, and the ever important starman for a short burst of invincibility.

Each level includes a bonus section filled with coins plus a shortcut through the level, plenty of bad buys and obstacles to get past, and an end of level flag, in which the higher the player grabs it, the more points are awarded to them. Certain levels also include warp points, which takes the player to higher levels.</desc>

However, that is not the most powerful tool at his disposal - Orin also has his trusty falcon that he can send around the room to attack enemies or trigger remote switches. In single-player mode, the player controls both the falconer and the falcon. However, the game also offers a cooperative mode where the first player controls Orin and the second player controls his falcon in a mode which offers greater flight capability.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you must help a little boy to become a baseball star. Your goal is to make it through elementary school and high school, to build up his personality (making him more attractive, etc.), and finally let him be drafted by a professional baseball team. All this is achieved through playing (alone, vs. computer, or in two-, three-, and four-player mode) a board game in which you take your hero through a series of fields. Unlike most similar games, the amount of fields you can advance is not determined by a dice roll, but by a moving power meter that you must stop at the right time in order to jump the desired amount of fields. Needless to say that those fields have very different effects on the participants. There are different stats (like stamina, charisma, etc.) that can be increased or reduced if you step on a particular field. For example, you might end up on a "eating" field, which will take you to a friend who will invite you to a dinner. This will result in increased weight, a parameter that will affect your future performance.</desc>

	<desc>In 1999 a mysterious object crashes into the desert and a mysterious creature, Darc Seed appears. Using magnetic powers, he soon turns the people of the United States into zombies and exerts influence over various weapons and objects. Among the weapons Darc Seed claims is the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi hears about this, he sets out for the United States to defeat Darc Seed and reclaim the sword.

What makes this so unusual however is that "great head of the samurai" is to be taken literally and Namakubi therefore is a giant disembodied head. His main weapon is the ability to shoot projectiles from his eyes and bombs from his mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks.

The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player can control Namakubi's movement across the screen and the ability to shoot. Enemies reduce health by varying amounts, health can be restored by increasing the player's score. The game features four distinct stages with 2 difficulty settings.</desc>

	<desc>The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a side-scrolling platformer based on the second animated TV series The Addams Family (1992). The entire Addams family is being held captive by various monsters throughout the mansion, and Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies.

This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of The Addams Family - it features the same storyline with another main character and almost identical level design. Another difference to the SNES version of this game is that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.</desc>

Grabbing his gun, Fester sets off to stop the aliens and slay their boss creatures, encountering other Addams Family members along the way who will aid him.

Fester's Quest is an overhead-view game in which Uncle Fester uses his gun, or later, a whip to attack enemies near him. Enemies drop money and power-ups. The money can be used at Hot Dog stands to replenish health. A variety of items can be collected, each with a different effect. Fester and the rest of the Addams family are based on their characters from the popular 1960s TV show (this game was made before the remakes in  both series and movie form).</desc>

	<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : Dragons of Flame [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Set in between the SSI's AD&amp;D Dragonlance action games Heroes of the Lance and Shadow Sorcerer. This game follows the tradition of Heroes of the Lance with a side-scrolling, action-oriented view, a breakaway from the standard GoldBox RPGs.  Plot-wise, it also takes place between those two games, following closely the novel/game modules written by Weiss/Hickman.

You take control of one character at a time, with each hero having different abilities.</desc>

	<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons - Dragon Strike [USA]</name>
	<desc>Unlike its namesake on computers, this version of DragonStrike is a straight action game with a top-down perspective. Set during the War of the Lance in the Dragonlance world of Krynn, the player controls dragons in missions against the forces of evil.

At the start of the game, one of three dragons can be selected (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different attributes in speed and armor and two different breath attacks. In each of the more than 12 missions, several objectives must be completed: enemy dragons must be hunted down, ships sunk and fortresses destroyed. The dragon can change between low and high altitudes to avoid obstacles and enemy fire and to attack certain types of enemies: ground troops can only be destroyed from the lower altitude, dragons only from the higher one. Killed enemy dragons leave power-ups that grant temporary protection, speed, or let the dragon regain health. Some of the missions include boss battles against large enemies like a giant kraken or a powerful dark wizard.

In two-player mode, the second player (who can select a different dragon) can continue in the mission where the previous player failed.</desc>

Each character has different types of attacks and spells making them more suited to fighting different enemies as well as acting as lives.

	<desc>Play a would-be hero in the city of Hillsfar, where action and adventure await the daring adventurer. Join the local guild and complete missions from the guild master in a quest for glory and gold!

Hillsfar is a "single-hero" role playing game (in comparison to other Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPGs, where the player usually controls a group of characters). A combination of 1st person perspective (when traveling in the city of Hillsfar) and 3rd person perspective (usually in some action-style mini-quests) viewpoints.

As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated mission-based plot: Thief, Mage, Fighter or Cleric. Each class, to a certain extent, has a different approach for completing quests.

In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various "mini-games" that are needed to complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master. These mini-games include, but are not limited to:

1. Fighting at the Arena (3rd Person Perspective)
Competing at the Archery Range (1st Person Perspective)
Exploring buildings or mazes (Top-down Perspective)
Riding a horse while avoiding obstacles (3rd Person Perspective/Side-Scrolling)
Locking picking doors and chests (1st Person Perspective)

Unlike most RPGs, there isn't any "randomly generated monster combat" in Hillsfar. RPG combat only occurs in the Arena.</desc>

	<desc>Your girlfriend is once again kidnapped by aliens, and you have to rescue her, forcing your way through various levels.

The gameplay and the design haven't much changed since Adventure Island II: Aliens in Paradise: there is a world map, you can choose items before starting a level, the levels themselves are quite short (unlike Adventure Island, where each large level contained several stages). You perform standard "adventure island" activities: ride various types of dinosaurs, throw boomerangs at snails, birds, snakes, and skulls, collect grapes and apples, jump over stones, and of course, ride your old trusty skateboard.

	<desc>In the South Pacific, Master Higgins lives peacefully wearing only a grass skirt and a cap. That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

	<desc>In Adventure Island II: Aliens in Paradise the player takes the role of Master Higgins who has to save his cavegirl from aliens which also want to dominate the Earth. The basic gameplay elements are the same as in its predecessor Adventure Island: Master Higgins walks through the levels while fighting against various enemies. One hit results in his untimely death unless he carries one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero.

A big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don't have to be used instantly but can be saved for later: before every level the player can choose the power ups he wants to bring with him. There are overall eight worlds with different themes which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes there are different paths with other level and at the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a boss.

	<desc>Somewhere in the land of dinosaurs, a hero known as Dino-Riki sets out to battle against the beasts of the ancient times and prove man's right to survival amongst evolution. You control Dino-Riki from a top-down perspective as the screen scrolls towards the top. Dino Riki must shoot the enemies in his way as well as leap over pits and avoid obstacles. His chances improve when he obtains weapon power-ups such as fireballs or boomerangs. Angel Wings also help and let Dino Riki fly above the ground. At the end of each level, Dino-Riki faces off against a boss creature.

	<name>The Adventures of Gilligan's Island [USA]</name>
	<desc>The plot is based on a TV sitcom of the 60's named Gilligan's Island.  Your ship crashed on a deserted island, and now you must get back to civilization.  The stranded people on the island are: Gilligan and the Skipper ( the crew of the ship), a millionaire and his wife, a professor, and Mariann who is a homely Midwest U.S.A. girl.

Despite the name, you'll be playing as the Skipper. Gilligan follows you around as a comedic relief sidekick. The game is divided into four episodes; the goal is always to locate all crew members in a limited amount of time. To do so the two heroes have to navigate the maze-like island and collect items - every found character provides hints for the next step.

There are also a lot of dangers which have to be faced: wild animals and headhunters can be fought with your bare hands and fallen rocks or obstacles on the ground have to be avoided. A common nuisance are holes in the ground which lead to the underground caves: Gilligan is likely to fall into these. If this happens Skipper has two minutes to get Gilligan back. There are three items which help Skipper on his quest: bananas replenish his health, hourglasses give extra time and the rope is used to get Gilligan back instantly.</desc>

	<desc>The lovely princess Lala was kidnapped by the Evil Demons of the Empire. You are Lolo, a round ball-like creature (just like the princess herself), and your mission is to sneak into the empire castle and to liberate the princess.

Adventures of Lolo is a puzzle game, and each level is a castle room. The goal in each room is to collect all the hearts. It is not always easy, because some hearts are blocked by enemies who will shoot you when you cross their path horizontally or vertically (or both). Once you collect all the hearts, a treasure chest will open and activate all the creatures in the room, even those who were not hostile until now. You must quickly cross the room to the exit which is now available to go to the next room. The game contains 50 rooms in total.

The difficulty level increases with each room, and after a few levels there is an especially hard room with tougher enemies.</desc>

With the main computer you can choose your next destination - but many puzzles rely on the usage of items found on a different world; e.g. an alien-translator.

	<desc>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel.  The game plays out much like an episode of the show.  The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum.  Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.

Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls.  Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show. During the platforming sections you can switch instantly between the two protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for short instances.

After this, you can access a large menu, where you can learn various things about yourself by talking to Ai Sensei. Those things include general horoscope, your destiny depending on the planets, your future love life, etc. The explanations can be quite detailed and are often accompanied by pictures, which vary depending on the character you have created.</desc>

	<name>Air Fortress [Europe]</name>
	<desc>The Federation of Intergalactic Powers is under threat by gigantic fortress spaceships which have suddenly appeared and destroyed nearby civilization. When conventional defense tactics fail, the Federation looks to find a specially selected person, Hal Bailman and equip him with a special "Lightship". His mission will to be to fly through the defenses of the eight known Air Fortresses and dock at the airlock. Then he must travel through the fortress in only a spacesuit to find and destroy the central core. Once the central core is destroyed, Hal must then quickly find the emergency lightship and escape before the fortress explodes.

The game is made up of two parts. The first part is a side-scrolling shooter on the surface of the air fortress where you must avoid various flying enemies and try to destroy as many waves as possible. This lasts until you dock with the airlock. Once docked, you walk the inside of the Air Fortress at your own pace. Hal is equipped with a jetpack rather than a jump as well as a blaster weapon and a more powerful bomb weapon. Any movement or firing you do consumes energy which is regenerated by standing still. Your goal is to blow up the core and find the escape ship before explosion.

Power-ups to increase Energy or Bombs can be found in each part of the game. Additionally, Super-bombs (clear screen of enemies) and Invulnerability can be found while flying the lightship.</desc>

	<name>Air Fortress [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The Federation of Intergalactic Powers is under threat by gigantic fortress spaceships which have suddenly appeared and destroyed nearby civilization. When conventional defense tactics fail, the Federation looks to find a specially selected person, Hal Bailman and equip him with a special "Lightship". His mission will to be to fly through the defenses of the eight known Air Fortresses and dock at the airlock. Then he must travel through the fortress in only a spacesuit to find and destroy the central core. Once the central core is destroyed, Hal must then quickly find the emergency lightship and escape before the fortress explodes.

The game is made up of two parts. The first part is a side-scrolling shooter on the surface of the air fortress where you must avoid various flying enemies and try to destroy as many waves as possible. This lasts until you dock with the airlock. Once docked, you walk the inside of the Air Fortress at your own pace. Hal is equipped with a jetpack rather than a jump as well as a blaster weapon and a more powerful bomb weapon. Any movement or firing you do consumes energy which is regenerated by standing still. Your goal is to blow up the core and find the escape ship before explosion.

Power-ups to increase Energy or Bombs can be found in each part of the game. Additionally, Super-bombs (clear screen of enemies) and Invulnerability can be found while flying the lightship.</desc>

Before each mission, the player is briefed and allowed to choose a primary and secondary weapon for Airwolf's firing buttons. From this, Airwolf then fires at enemies that appear on the screen and approaches a boss weapon.

	<desc>The game is based on the detective story Ghost Train, the first one written by the popular Japanese author Akagawa Jiro. You play a young detective who investigates a strange case: eight people have disappeared, and rumors are heard about a mysterious Ghost Train. You head to a remote village to learn more about those events. In this adventure game, you can move your hero from third-person perspective, but you can leave a screen only via a menu command. The menu is unique to each location; in some of them, you'll be able to investigate a room by moving around a cursor and clicking on objects, while in others you'll talk to people about various topics.

	<name>Akira [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animé movie of the same name. The year is 2019, 31 years after World War III. The events of the game (and of the movie) take place in a futuristic city called New Tokyo, which is controlled by corrupted military and rival gangs. You control Kaneda, the leader of one of such guys, and the main character in the movie. Kaneda's childhood friend, Tetsuo, is injured during the highway chase, and taken by the military. While trying to free your friend, you find out a strange power is growing inside him...

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure. Instead of a menu with set commands, you have different options on each screen. After watching a cutscene or scrolling through a dialogue, you have several options to choose from. In many situations, some options will lead to Kaneda's death or imprisonment, which is Game Over. There are no real puzzles or anything of the sort, but if you choose the "examine" option which is available on most screens, you can move the cursor around the screen and choose what exactly you want to examine.</desc>

While driving on a lonely road at night, a strange figure blocks your vision causing you to swerve and crash your car. When you regain consciousness, you find that your brother is missing (in the NES-Version it's your sister who is missing). The only place he could have gone is a creepy old mansion which looms in front of you. With nowhere else to go, you enter the mansion in search of your brother. It turns out the mansion once belonged to an old wizard and his apprentice, and somehow it has become infested with the Undead.</desc>

A vampire hunter named Simon Belmont bravely ventures into the Count's mansion in order to defeat him. Along the way he'll have to defeat skeletons, bats, fishmen, medusa heads and other evil creatures.

Castlevania is a side-scrolling platform action game. The player taking the role of Simon Belmont is able to jump and crack his whip directly in front of him. Power-ups can be obtained by defeating enemies or by whipping candles that appear in the castle. One such power-up increases the power and length of Simon's whip.  Different weapons can be gathered which consume hearts when used, these hearts can also be collected from monsters and candles. Additionally, some walls will hide secrets such as the health-restorative turkey or the Double and Triple shot abilities for the weapons Simon has collected. At the end of each section of the castle is a boss, which must be defeated. Progression through the castle eventually leads to a confrontation with Count Dracula himself.</desc>

	<desc>Kid Dracula is an unusual side-scroller from Konami.  It's  a parody of the company's popular Castlevania series. Instead of playing as a member of the Belmont family, you play as young Kid Dracula.

You have been woken up from your sleep by the evil demon Garamos, who's been wrecking havoc in Dracula's Castle. It's up to you to stop him by traveling across several different locations, including Dracula's Castle, New York, the Sea, and Egypt!

Gameplay consists of very standard jump and shoot platform action.  As you progress through the 8 levels, you gain the ability to perform spells, such as turning into a bat, and different special attacks, such as a spread / homing attack. You can also spend the coins you get when you defeat enemies in one of several mini-games that show up when you're between levels.

	<name>Aladdin [Europe]</name>
	<desc>The game from Virgin based on the 1992 animated Disney film is a side-scrolling platformer.

The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan's dungeon to the final confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar's palace. The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.

The game's humorous animations were created by Walt Disney Feature Animation.

	<name>La Alfombra Magica [Spain] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>Magic Carpet 1001 (called "Arabian Nights" in Chinese) is an unlicensed shoot-'em-up developed by Mega Soft (NTDEC) and distributed by NTDEC in 1991, Caltron and Gluk Video in 1992 and Asder in 1993 as part of the Asder 20-in-1 multicart. Its Caltron 6-in-1 incarnation is arguably the most well-known.
The game is a standard NES shoot-'em-up. It is four levels long and mostly takes place in an Arabian setting, with the fourth level being in space. There are many enemies that stand in the way of your character (an Aladdin-type who rides a magic carpet, although the title screen suggests he is a genie) which follow set patterns that become more complex with each level.
As well as this, all four levels have a different boss; a witch, a snake in a flying jar, a giant skull and giant lips respectively, with the latter often being considered to be far too difficult. Numerous power-ups can be collected at random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your character's health. By default, your character starts with 6 lives, dies in one hit and he can only fire one shot on the screen at a time.
Oddly for a shooter, this game does not have a score system whatsoever and the levels progress with the only warning being that the screen fades out after the boss. The ending is a picture of your character and (presumably) the damsel in distress you were rescuing, followed by a credits screen which has some of the names that appear in other Mega Soft games.
This game was later hacked in 1995 to produce Aladdin III, which is identical apart from the title screen which removes the company name and logo, as well as decreasing protagonist's minimal speed. This one appears on several multicarts. It is also unrelated to the Hummer Team pirate.</desc>

	<desc>Alfred the chicken must rescue his friends and his bird (pardon the pun) Floella from the Meka Chickens. The result is a platform game across differently-themed levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</desc>

	<name>Alien 3 [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Alien³ on the NES is similar to Probe Software's adaptations of the film on other systems. While using the same overall game concept as the Sega and Commodore versions, the NES title has unique levels.

The player controls Ripley through a number of platform levels. She must not only defend herself against hordes of aliens and find the exit, but also save a number of prisoners, all within a tight time limit of only minutes per level.

Weapons to use against the aliens include a pulse rifle, flame thrower, grenade launcher as well as hand grenades. Ammo for each is limited and must be collected in the levels. The rifle is prone to overheating, so should only be fired in short bursts.

Next to health packs, Ripley can also find a radar. The radar indicates both moving aliens as well as the locations of prisoners.

After every two levels, a guardian level follows, in which an especially tough alien must be defeated to continue.

	<name>All Pro Basketball [USA]</name>
	<desc>Video round ball seems to come in a variety of court sizes and player numbers. All-Pro Basketball combines five-on-five full-court action with a half-court screen view.

All-Pro style B-ball features several different play options. Go head-to-head with a friend in a one-game contest. Or, watch two computer teams battle it out on court. If you choose league competition your task is to lead your team to the league championship. In Two Player league play you and a buddy team up to battle the computer teams. Choose your squad from eight professional rosters - ranging from the New York Slicks to the San Francisco Bayriders. Each team has their own strengths and weaknesses.

When the scene is set, the game begins with a jump ball and then it's non-stop no-holds-barred B-ball. On offense you're the team - running, jumping, jump passing, shooting, and even going for three pointers or slam dunks. On defense make a steal or grab a rebound. And remember this is real video basketball. You get called for fouls and your teammates get tired. When their health and stamina get low it's up to you to put them on the bench for a rest.

	<desc>In Amagon, your mission is to investigate a dangerous, monster-infested island.  As Amagon, you begin the game with only a machine gun and a limited amount of ammo to protect yourself from the inhabitants of the island. Gameplay is an arcade style platform game with six levels, each with a variety of creatures and a large boss at the end. When you destroy an enemy, a power up will sometimes be left behind. Collecting these can give you extra points, an extra life, more ammo, or a mega key. If you have enough points and collect a mega key, you then have the ability to transform into Megagon. In this form, you are larger in size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you, points are lost. When all of the mega points are gone you will transform back into your normal size.</desc>

	<name>America Oudan Ultra Quiz - Shijou Saidai no Tataka [Japan]</name>
	<desc>This game has two modes: story and tournament. Tournament mode is the simpler one: you compete against seven opponents in a quiz that concerns various historical, geographical, social, and cultural aspects of United States of America. Some questions require you to choose "yes" or "no", while others present you a short list of possible answers, of which you should choose the correct one. The participants' responses are timed.

In the story mode, you can navigate the character you created (male or female) in a top-down city. Avoiding getting hit by the numerous cars in the area, you must make your way to competition halls and participate in quiz shows. More areas will be unlocked as you win the tournaments. This time, giving the correct answer is more than just quickly choosing a word. Giving an answer is presented each time with a mini-game. For example, in one of the competitions answering a question involves running through a football field and making it to the correct part of the touchdown area, which is divided into large "yes" and "no" sections.</desc>

In the "game mode", you are brought in a helicopter onto a top-down "world map" area. You are told that this is Brooklyn, New York, and begin to roam the area, gradually gaining access to different casino houses. There are also random encounters, during which you'll be able to bet some money and operate a slot machine directly from the world map.</desc>

	<desc>Anticipation is a video board game for one to four players (both computer and human). The object of the game is to be the first to collect a card for each of the four colors on the game board. During each turn the computer will display seemingly random dots, then a pencil starts connecting the dots to form a picture. The first player to correctly identify the picture will earn a card for the color of the picture being drawn. As the picture draws, a dice on the screen will count down from 6 to 1. Whatever value is showing when a player successfully identifies the picture is the number of spaces that players game piece will move on the game board for the next turn. The color of the space the game piece lands on will dictate the category for the next picture to be drawn. 

Each game will choose four categories from the various options, which include: tools, man made, clothing, food, math, office, travel, music, things, natural, leisure, and many others. After you've mastered the easier skill levels, the difficulty can be increased which will present more complicated pictures, remove some of the dots from the picture, or eliminate the dots entirely.</desc>

You'll also be attacked by enemies with whom you'll engage in strategic, party-vs.-party combat. You can choose from three character classes: Fighter, Saint, and Magician. Each class has its own special abilities that you'll use in battles as well as during your exploration of the game world.</desc>

	<name>Arctic [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as "active rail playing". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.</desc>

The game scrolls upward as waves of enemies attempt to impede your progress, shooting slow and fast moving bullets at your ship.  Armed with air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, blast your way forward while looking for bonuses. Crudely drawn buildings must be shot or avoided since it is possible to crash into them.   While moving forward the game allows your ship to move as far left or right as necessary.  Finally, at the end of each level you will have to destroy a large enemy.</desc>

	<name>Arkanoid [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.</desc>

All the elves hope lies in one elf warrior named Christine.  Equipped in the beginning with only a bow, she proceeds to find the ring and restore her home back to normal.

This is a game that may be compared to The Legend of Zelda, though more linear in it's game play. The game is broken down into many stages, the goal of each being to simply find a way into the next stage.  Playing out in puzzle fashion, you will shoot all the enemies on screen, earn the hidden key, and find the correct exit.  Defeated enemies will randomly drop bonuses that can be collected; these items include health restore, increased armor, and weapon improvements.

Beating the entire game requires successful progression through 125 stages.</desc>

The matters become even more complicated when the famous Billy The Shell also embarks on a quest to save Sheryl. Will Armadillo be able to rescue the girl and to defeat his enemies?

In this game, you move Armadillo around an area map composed of squares. Some of them are empty, while others represent locations. Once you enter a location, you find yourself on a platform level, that often contains several sub-levels. There are sometimes branching ways on the area map, and you are not obliged to access all the locations to clear an area. On the platform levels, Armadillo can either walk and jump in his normal form (dies from single enemy hit), or turn into a ball, which is invulnerable to enemies' attacks, but is hard to control: the ball follows realistic physics, bounces of walls, and takes time to stop rolling. During the game, Armadillo will also be able to find upgrades that will allow him to take an animal's form for a short time.</desc>

	<name>Artelius [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Long time ago, an advanced civilization existed in the Solar System. But one day, a black hole appeared nearby. Many people were sucked into it an transported into another dimension, which they named Artelius. It was ruled by the evil king Sarbelor, who constructed a machine named Galax, which tore the dimension into lonely asteroid-filled spaces accessed by warp points. The peace-loving scientist Dr. Rado built you, a cyborg who can travel through space, and entrusted you with the mission of finding and destroying Sarbelor.

This game is an action RPG. You navigate the hero in top-down view through space; chains of asteroids represent inaccessible areas on the map. You travel between various space areas by approaching warp points. The enemies randomly appear on the screen around you. When you contact an enemy, a battle begins. Battles are viewed from first person perspective; you are in control of a cross-hair, which you must move around the screen and press the fire button when you place it over the enemy. There are also special attacks at your disposal, which require weapon points (WP). Winning the battles gives you experience points, allowing you to gain levels ("classes") and become stronger.</desc>

	<desc>Asmik is not only a name of a game-developing company, but, as we learn from this game, also a cute little pink dragon. Recently, monsters began to invade the peaceful country of the dragons. The only way to stop this invasion is to contact the six Dragon Gods. Unfortunately, those gods seem to be asleep. So now Asmik must travel all over the world to find six magical splitters, that will help him to awaken the dragons and to defeat the monsters.

This is a traditional action platform game. Asmik can jump and exhale steam from his nostrils to turn all his enemies into eggs. Those eggs can be eaten and later used for various purposes (during boss battles, acquiring upgrades at a shop that becomes available once you have completed a stage, etc.). Asmik dies if he comes into close contact with an enemy. Boss battles differ from the rest of the game, each one being a mini-game of its own, for example a rock-paper-scissors game during which Asmik uses his correct choices to gain time to proceed to the next stage.</desc>

	<desc>Somewhere in the galaxy lies the planet RS-121  a desolate planet that has suffered terrible disasters which made life impossible. Only one construction still remains on the planet  a highway called Black Line. It is said than an ancient legend is somehow connected to this highway. You, a man named Riber, decide to participate in a racing competition on the Black Line. But be ready  the competition can bring deadly results...

In this racing game, you drive your car on the highway through pseudo-3D environments. The opponents will not hesitate to push you outside the road. You can either squeeze between them (pressing the Down button will make your car smaller), or shoot at them with a limited amount of missiles. On the way there will be shops where you'll be able to repair and upgrade your car.

If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. 

The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.</desc>

	<desc>In "Atlantis no Nazo", you play a nameless archaeologist who must descend into the dangerous caverns of the lost continent Atlantis, and eventually find his way to the inner sanctum with the legendary treasure. The game plays like a standard action-based platformer. The levels feature plenty of enemies and gaps you must jump over. Your only weapon are sticks of dynamite. When you throw a stick, it will bounce off the floor and explode only after a couple of seconds, so very precise aiming and timing are needed to defeat the enemies. Many levels contain optional treasure chests as well as hidden doors that lead to bonus levels. Sometimes level progression is non-linear, i.e. you can jump straight to a high-numbered zone if you find the correspondent door on the level. All the levels are timed. The protagonist dies when he falls into a pit, touches an enemy, or runs out of time.</desc>

	<name>Attack Animal Gakuen [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Attack Animal School is more than a little inspired by Sega's popular Space Harrier, but with a cuter setting. As in its role model, you fly towards the screen or run on the ground, rendered in a checkered 3D field. The hero has been replaced with a uniform-clad schoolgirl, who must shoot down enemies which come flying, jumping or crawling towards her. The enemies are no longer spaceships, asteroids or dragons. Instead, they are various cute and furry animals, such as kangaroos, cacti with sweatbands, turtles and flies. The end-of-level dragons are also decidedly cuter, with the first level boss being a fluffy koala. Attack Animal Gakuen is one of few Famicom games to support the 3D glasses (like Space Harrier 3D for the Master System), though it is perfectly playable without glasses.</desc>

	<desc>Based off the cartoon show of the same name, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes places young Chad Finletter on a quest to make his way past evil mutant tomatoes and stop the crazy Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen from unleashing his Doomsday Tomato. With all the citizens of San Zucchini terrified of the fanged vegetables coming from the sewers, Chad will be on his own to take on the tomato scourge. The doctor doesn't take him lightly, however, and has sent his special tomato squad, Zoltan, Beefstake, Mummato, Fang, Ketchuck and Tomacho, to stop him.

The game is a side-scrolling platform jumping game where the main method of stopping the killer tomatoes is to jump on them. From that they'll either splatter, run away or transform into smaller tomato bits. Energy Power-ups exist to refill Chad's health.</desc>

	<desc>In this soccer game, two players can play a single match between any of the 8 teams available, or one player can play either one of the two championships available.

The Ultimate League Soccer championship let the player choose one of 8 national teams: France, England, United States, Argentina, Italy, Brazil, Australia or Germany. The other championship available restricts the choice to the 4 first teams: France, England, United States and Argentina. Each national team has its own characteristics, varying in offensive, defense, speed, skill, accuracy and experience traits.

After selecting the team, players are prompted to choose the color of their team's uniform, among white, green, gray and red. They are also prompted to choose the duration of the periods (15, 30 or 45 minutes - which run faster than real time). They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.

The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective. While conducting the ball layers can make short passes (with button B) or strong kicks (with button A, stronger the longer the button is held). Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.

Players can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.</desc>

	<desc>One day while nobody was looking, Baby Boomer climbed out of his crib and headed into the woods.  Little did he realize that while he's enjoying this adventurous journey into the unknown, there are many dangers awaiting him!  Your job is to use your Zapper to protect Baby Boomer and help him find his way home to his mother. Unlike other Zapper games, you can shoot just about anything you see in Baby Boomer.  Some things give extra points, while others give extra lives, open secret passages, control something in another part of the world or clear a safe route for Baby Boomer to follow.</desc>

	<name>Back to the Future [USA]</name>
	<desc>In Back to the Future, 80s teen Marty McFly is mistakenly send 30 years into the past where he disrupts his own parents from meeting. Faced with extinction at the hands of a temporal paradox, Marty must find a way to reunite his future parents and make it back to his own time.

LJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.

Street running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).</desc>

	<desc>Welcome to the world of Bad News Baseball, a place where rabbits serve as umpires, home runs escape the earth's atmosphere, and batters are knocked unconscious when they make an out.

Bad News Baseball is a Japanese import for a younger audience. The game has two leagues - the Ultra and Super leagues - with 12 teams that represent major league cities which use fictional team and player names. There are several modes to choose from at the start of the game. You can play a One Player tournament versus the computer: pick a team and play against every other team once. Or, you can play a three-game series against a friend. There's also an all-star mode, which enables you to build a 23-player team from the rosters of one of the leagues. And if you want to watch a game, there's a spectator mode.</desc>

	<desc>Side-scroller in which you get to beat up innocent people. Although it's seems kind of strange, the game is just that: walk around the street as a wrestler wannabe and beat up grannies, blind men, gorillas and other bystanders. But try not to get beaten as the granny attempts to give you some of your own medicine by flailing her purse at you.

Kicks and punches are your basic moves at first, but as the game progresses and you advance levels, new moves and attacks become available, and new people to beat up as well. It's public mayhem way before the likes of Grand Theft Auto.</desc>

	<desc>This game is a humorous "star simulation", or, better to say, a strategy game with elements of luck, in which your goal is to become a famous musician or a star of the Japanese theater, particularly succeeding in monomane, a technique of imitation. There are four characters in the game which are controlled by players or computer. The turns of the game are determined by a roll of dice. The characters are located on a city map, and move around it according to the number that their dice rolled, somewhat similarly to monopoly-type board games. Each time you stop, you access a location where various things happen: you can select theater pieces and perform on stage, try to impress people, etc. Sometimes you land on a location that leads to a mini-game (swimming, playing ball, and others). Winning such a game gives an additional boost to your career.</desc>

	<desc>In "Bakushou!! Ai no Gekijou", you create one to four characters. You choose their name and gender, as well as their parents (from several available ones). This determines the personality and the abilities of your characters (their intelligence level, physical condition, etc.). You then guide your teenager characters through a series of typical events. For example, at the beginning you'll be in school and will have to solve simple mathematical exercises. After that, you are presented with a calendar, which is your board in the game. You cannot control the actions of the characters, but depending on the way you have created them, and on the day the game will randomly choose for you, events will occur in their life, some of which are completely ordinary (like going out and meeting someone), while others will grant your characters more intelligence, physical condition, or let them earn or spend money. The game will also determine what personal relationship the characters will have with each other, and whether a romantic involvement is possible.</desc>

	<desc>Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou is a board game which is at the same time a life simulation. Four characters participate in the game, one of which is controlled by you, and the others either by the computer AI, or by other players. In the beginning, all your characters are at a "starting position", on a map that is composed of circles, some of which are empty, while others represent a building or a certain event. A roll of dice determines how many moves the character will make. Depending on the circle the character steps on, different things will occur. Random circles will take you to a journey or depict a simple day spent with your family. Others will add money to the character, or make him train and raise his physical condition, etc. The characters move over the entire board, living their lives, visiting school, meeting with each other, etc.

The game is best played as multiplayer, but you can also allow the computer to play for other characters, or create all of them on your own. In the game, you are presented with a board which is composed of tiles. A roll of dice determines the amount of steps a character will take on the board. Depending on the tile he steps on, different events will occur. If the tile is empty, a random event will happen. Other tiles are connected to a certain aspect of a person's life. For example, "learning" tiles will trigger an event that will make the character more intelligent (like studying for the school), and a tile with a "love" icon will lead to a romantic encounter and raise the love level of the character.</desc>

	<desc>The third game in "Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou" series follows the same principles as the first two. It is a board game that simulates the lives of up to four characters. You can create all the characters on your own, let the computer AI handle them, or play with other players. You move your character(s) through the game world (it doesn't look like a board, like in the first two games, but still works the same way). The amount of steps is determined randomly: a spinning indicator will eventually stop on one of the numbers, from 1 to 6, similar to a dice roll. Unlike the first two games, there are no special icons on the board, all you see is a usual neighborhood with houses, streets, etc. Random events will happen to your characters during their life. Most of those events will modify your character's parameters. For example, a school event will increase their knowledge, sports will raise their physical condition, etc. You'll earn or lose money depending on the event. Your characters will also meet up with each other, fall in love, and experience other events, good or bad.</desc>

	<name>Ballblazer [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In the year 3037, the most competitive sport in the known universe is Ballblazer. For the first time ever, humans from the planet Earth have won the right to compete in the final round of the Ballblazer Championship, to fight for Earth's honor and the title Masterblazer!

Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). The objective of the player to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent.

The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. 

The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game.

Scoring

Close-in goals - 1 point
Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points
OTH shots - 3 points
Players may steal points from each other by making goals. 
The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points.
A player winning 10 consecutive points automatically wins the game.</desc>

First, the mole cannot jump or climb up unless there is a ladder nearby. So you have to plan your route ahead, otherwise you can get stuck at the bottom. Second, boulders will fall and block your way. And third, you have a wife. You should first find her, and then lead her securely to the exit. The wife will sometimes make things harder, forcing you to find alternate ways to the exit. But sometimes she'll also be helpful, pushing away boulders and clearing the road for you. 

On every level, there is also various food scattered around, primarily bananas. You'll be able to complete a level if you have gathered enough of those fruits. You'll also gain superpowers from bananas that will allow you to skip level sections that you find too difficult. The entire game is played only with the four directional buttons. There are no enemies and you cannot die - although you can get irrevocably stuck, in which case you'll have to restart a level.</desc>

	<name>Bandai Golf : Challenge Pebble Beach [USA]</name>
	<desc>One or Two players can play a round on this video course modeled after the real Pebble Beach. Each player can select their own handicap. Every one of the 18 holes has familiar golf hazards - bunkers, slopes, and water hazards. You'll also have to contend with some of Mother Nature's hazards like changing wind conditions and Pebble Beach's most difficult obstacle - the ocean.

Once you tee off you'll have all kinds of decisions to make. Check your score card to see how you're doing. The card tells you the distance in yards and par for each hole. The computer gives you a bird's-eye view and cross-sectional view of each hole, as well as close-ups of the green. You select the right club for each shot. Control your shot to get the power, distance, and hook or slice you want on the ball. After you've made your shot the computer tells you what kind of lie you have as well as the remaining distance to the hole.

	<name>Bandit Kings of Ancient China [USA]</name>
	<desc>In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial Minister Gao Qiu.  The Song Dynasty comes to an end, and Gao Qiu became the new ruler.  You take the role of an exiled ruler, and you must build your stats up to be able to challenge- and destroy- Gao Qiu and restore Hui Zhong to the throne.

The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei's games, but instead of conquering a country, the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China.  You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles.  You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.</desc>

	<name>The Bard's Tale II - The Destiny Knight [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The sequel to the popular RPG Bard's Tale. After your characters defeated the wizard Mangar the Dark and freed Skara Brae from eternal winter, all seemed well in the world. Fortunately for your employment prospects, the evil Archmage Lagoth Zanta shows up and splits the Destiny Wand into seven pieces, scattering them all over the land. The Destiny Wand has protected the lands for 700 years, and without it the realm will fall into chaos. Thus it falls upon your party to reforge the Destiny Wand. Also, one among you must ascend to the position of Archmage and use the wand to defeat Lagoth Zanta.

Bard's Tale 2 uses the same engine as the original with similar gameplay, but takes place in a much larger game world, featuring several different cities (instead of just Skara Brae). You can generate new characters or import characters from the previous Bard's Tale.

Long ago, when magic still prevailed, the evil wizard Mangar the Dark threatened a small but harmonious country town called Skara Brae. Evil creatures oozed into Skara Brae and joined his shadow domain. Mangar froze the surrounding lands with a spell of Eternal Winter, totally isolating Skara Brae from any possible help. Then, one night the town militiamen all disappeared. The future of Skara Brae hung in the balance. And who was left to resist?

You are the leader of this ragtag group of freedom fighters. Luckily you have a Bard with you to sing your glories, if you survive. For this is the stuff of legends.

	<desc>In Baseball Simulator 1.000 you can choose from four different leagues; three with six preset teams each and one where you can build the teams yourself from scratch. Face the computer or challenge a friend to compete in a 5, 30, 60, or 165 game season. Games take place in six stadiums.

As the manager you build up your team by allocating a set bunch of points for batting average, home runs, running speed, and fielding ability among your players. Then, you customize your pitching staff by divvying up points for ERA, speed, right and left curve balls, sinking pitches, and stamina. Your managerial responsibilities also include deciding who's right-handed and who's a lefty, and whether your pitchers throw overhand or sidearm.

You can also play in the Ultra League. Ultra League play enables you to give your hitters and pitchers special skills, such as the ability to pitch balls that zig zag, or hit balls that explode on contact.</desc>

	<name>Bases Loaded 3 [USA]</name>
	<desc>Bases Loaded 3 was Jaleco's latest entry into the popular baseball series in 1991. Changes over the previous title included slightly more detailed fielders, a new field perspective (home plate at the top of the screen, center field at the bottom), an editable team, and a new goal: to play the perfect game of baseball against the computer. Simply winning the game was no longer enough; the gamer now had to avoid common baseball missteps such as making an error and striking out, in order to earn a perfect rating. Against the very clever computer pitching, this could prove quite difficult.</desc>

	<desc>Bases Loaded 4 was Jaleco's last 8-bit entry in the long-running baseball series. The game featured slightly more elaborate animations than its predecessor, and much larger fielders. Removed was the goal to play a flawless game; instead the game featured more traditional modes, including exhibition games and full season play.

Geared more toward faced-paced arcade gameplay than simulation, Bases Loaded 4 was not licensed by Major League Baseball or the Major League Baseball Players' Association. Therefore, it did not feature real American (or Japanese, for that matter) teams or players.</desc>

	<desc>In this version of Bases Loaded you coach your team through a 130-game season in either an Eastern or western division of a professional baseball league. Win the pennant and you're off to the World Series! You can also play head-to-head with a friend.

Choose from six teams in each division. Once you take your place in the dugout you're the manager, juggling your own lineup and battling order. You'll also have to somewhat of a psychologists as you learn to interpret the Player Performance Ratings. This unique feature of Bases Loaded II rates each player in three categories: physical, sensitivity, and intellectual. Each rating is like a biorhythm, going up and down, just like in real life. The Player Performance Ratings simulate what players really go through - streaks and slumps.
Bases Loaded II also features similar realistic on-field action that was present in the first game of the series.</desc>

	<name>Bashi Bazook - Morphoid Masher [USA] (Proto)</name>
	<desc>The year is 2081. The Earth has become a devastated planet, overrun by monsters, controlled by a mysterious entity known as Increaser. The only hope to save the beloved Earth lies with you, a young warrior named Dan. You are sent in a time machine to the year 1999, when the monster invasion was beginning. Your task is to find your way through monster-infested labyrinths and to defeat the Increaser  whatever he (or it) is.

The game is an action platformer with more emphasis on exploration than on "jump &amp; run" gameplay. You don't die immediately if a monster touches you, but have a life bar that gets gradually depleted as you are hit. Defeated enemies bring you energy points, which you can spend to buy upgrades. You start with a sword, but later obtain other weapons as well. The game's structure is not entirely linear; many areas have different doors leading to different places.</desc>

	<desc>The Joker lives again in SunSoft's sequel to their NES 
original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must fight him across seven stages to restore peace to Gotham City.

Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses. 

Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.

Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers. Two levels require you to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep pace in the background. Some levels also have Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short side-scrolling shooter. 

This game is one of the few Batman games that was not based directly on a movie or television series.

	<name>Batman : The Video Game [Europe]</name>
	<desc>The NES version of Batman: The Video Game is loosely based on the 1989 movie. It is a side-scrolling game, with a blue dressed Batman fighting enemies such as robots, jet-packed soldiers, ninjas and mutants.

The game consists in five levels somewhat related to the movie: Gotham City streets (with Killer Moth as the final boss), AXIS Chemical Factory (with Machine Intelligence System as boss), Underground Conduit (with Electrocutioner as boss), the Laboratory Ruins (the Dual-Container Alarm as boss) and Gotham's Cathedral (with Firebug as boss) where Batman finally faces the Joker. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed.

Besides his ever trusting punches, Batman has plenty of weapons in his utility belt: the Batarang, the Spear Gun and the Dirk (a three direction weapon). Batman has an ammunition counter shared for the three weapons. The Batarang takes one pellet per shot, the Spear Gun two pellets and the Dirk, three. Batman also has an eight hit life bar, which can be replenished by collecting hearts dropped by killed enemies. The enemies will also drop pellet items (10 pellets per item) and bonus items (which will only sum up points).

Batman can also perform a "wall jump": he'll grab a wall when jumping toward it, allowing him to escalate some narrow passages. Batman has three lives and unlimited continues.

	<desc>The NES version of Batman: The Video Game is loosely based on the 1989 movie. It is a side-scrolling game, with a blue dressed Batman fighting enemies such as robots, jet-packed soldiers, ninjas and mutants.

The game consists in five levels somewhat related to the movie: Gotham City streets (with Killer Moth as the final boss), AXIS Chemical Factory (with Machine Intelligence System as boss), Underground Conduit (with Electrocutioner as boss), the Laboratory Ruins (the Dual-Container Alarm as boss) and Gotham's Cathedral (with Firebug as boss) where Batman finally faces the Joker. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed.

Besides his ever trusting punches, Batman has plenty of weapons in his utility belt: the Batarang, the Spear Gun and the Dirk (a three direction weapon). Batman has an ammunition counter shared for the three weapons. The Batarang takes one pellet per shot, the Spear Gun two pellets and the Dirk, three. Batman also has an eight hit life bar, which can be replenished by collecting hearts dropped by killed enemies. The enemies will also drop pellet items (10 pellets per item) and bonus items (which will only sum up points).

	<name>Batman Returns [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Like Konami's other adaptation of Batman Returns, the NES version is a side-scrolling beat 'em up. Next to brawling action, it also features two sections where the player controls the Batmobile and the Batskiboat seen in the movie.

In the beat 'em up sections, Batman has to defeat a large number of enemies (members of the Penguin's circus gang) to advance. Possible attacks include punches, sliding attacks, drop kicks and a powerful 360° cape slash attack which will drain Batman's health bar. Gadgets to be used include a limited number of batarangs and a grappling hook. The hook is useful for many things: it can take down flying enemies, pull Batman up to higher levels, lets him climb into open windows and more. Hidden in background items somewhere in the levels are power-ups, including hearts that refill the health bar and extra batarangs.

Each of the six levels in the game concludes with a boss fight against one or more especially powerful enemies.

The Batmobile is armed with machine guns and bat discs, used to dispatch the enemy bikes and cars in the driving level. The Batskiboat section is similar, except that there are no enemies and the only goal is to collect coins for extra points.</desc>

	<desc>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. 

The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. 

Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.</desc>

	<desc>In the year 2525, things are a mess. politically. Terrorists led by someone named "X" want to attack the United Nations. The CIA is in charge of discouraging the attacks. To that end, and since all of their best agents have failed the task, they send out an unofficial agent -- you, the Super Spy Hunter.

The Super Spy Hunter has a super spy car. It's actually a well-armed car that can turn into a boat or a plane at opportune times. The action is fast vertical scrolling as the vehicle faces all manner of powerful vehicle threats from a well-funded terrorist enemy -- cars, trucks, helicopters, etc. Luckily, there are many powerups to collect along the way, both defensive and offensive.</desc>

Each of these has side-scrolling sections in which Orpheus fights his way through the minions of Hades. There are various items one must get to continue to the next location, including swords, shields and crystals. There are three fragments of love hidden around; Orpheus has to find them before he can enter Tartarus and fight Hades to save his beloved Helene.

	<desc>You are bee number 52, and you need to collect enough honey every day to fill your quota. But the backyard can be a dangerous place for a bee! Spiders, grasshoppers, assorted bugs, and even lawn sprinklers are all over the place and try to stop bee 52 from reaching the many flowers where honey can be collected. Even after collecting honey, you may need to defend your nest against ants who will try to sneek in and steal honey from you. Bee 52 is armed, however, and can sting or shoot many of the enemies that get in the way. Some levels even have bugs that, when shot, will provide bee 52 with more powerful firepower temporarily. Bee 52 is a side scrolling shooter which can be played by one or two players.</desc>

	<name>Bible Buffet [USA] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>This is a Bible trivia/action game in which you spin a spinner and move the number of spaces it says. 

When you land on your spot, if it is just a regular spot, you play an action game for points, upgraded or better weapons, hearts, etc. If the space you land on has a red circle, you spin again. If the space you land on has a red circle connected to another red circle by dashes, you move forward or backwards to the second circle. If the space has a red circle with a question mark in it, you take a pop quiz of  three trivia questions then get to select either a key, a heart or move ahead one, two, three or four spaces. 

When you spin, if you don't get a number but instead get the book, you get a pop quiz of three questions. If you get the happy face, something good happens like move ahead ten space, get a key, get a heart, etc. If you get the sad face, something bad happens like lose your turn, move back 1 space and lose turn, etc. 

When you take a quiz, if you answer all three questions right, you get a star.

At the end of the game, a bonus is awarded to the player who got to the end first and/or got the most pop quiz stars and/or collected the most food then all the points are shown for each player.</desc>

	<desc>On a Tuesday afternoon sometime in 17 million BC, Big Nose the caveman was on his way to the Savings and Bones to deposit a large amount of savings. But before he got there, Leroy the Lizardman knocked out Big Nose and stole his savings. When Big Nose woke up and realized his savings were gone, he freaked out! Now he created a wheel with a platform on it and is out to get Leroy. Big Nose Freaks Out is a side scrolling platform action game. There are five sections of gameplay each with four levels to clear. At the end of each section Leroy will be waiting with a large monster. To fight back Big Nose has his trusty club with him. Also, rocks can be found along the way and the club used to bat them at enemies. There are many hidden treasures, hidden levels, and even some level warps to search for.</desc>

	<desc>Long, long time ago (but not necessarily in a galaxy far, far away), there was a caveman named Big Nose. One day he went out of his cave and saw a pterodactyl flying around. "That will be my dinner", - thought Big Nose, took out his trusty club and ran after the winged reptile. Naturally, his quest for nutrition became much longer and more dangerous than he had ever imagined...

In this platform action game, you guide Big Nose through prehistoric levels, fighting prehistoric animals of various kinds. Big Nose starts out with his club, but will gain other, more powerful weapons. During your quest you can collect bones, which are the currency of the game. There are shops in which you can buy weapons and various spells that you'll be able to cast.</desc>

	<desc>Another tournament composed of several different challenges rocks the streets near Nekketsu High and since the series hero Kunio isn't going to turn down a challenge anytime soon, every gang in the city sends its team hoping to come up on top.

Crash 'N the Boys: Street Challenge features the same basic gameplay engine and mechanics found in the rest of the Kunio/Nekketsu High games. The player controls a character in side-scrolling levels and try to defeat opponents using an arsenal of attacks and special moves. Unique to this game is that in order to clear the five stages, the player must also accomplish a series of sport-themed objectives. There is a throwing event, a golfing event, swimming, jumping, and all-out fighting events, all with unique twists inspired by the street/gangs theme of the game (e.g. the jumping event involves jumping across the rooftops in the city).

Depending on the player's performance in each event they may earn medals that can be exchanged for power-ups and stat increases. The game supports two players co-op or vs. gameplay.

	<name>Bikkuriman World: Gekit Sei Senshi [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the animé series "Bikkuriman World". Once upon a time, the world was a peaceful place. Three races - Angels, Demons, and Talismans - co-existed in the world, protected by the Holy Goddess Nadia. One day, Nadia sent her twin children into the world. Jura, the head of the Demons, abducted one of the children and devoured it. The other child took refuge by the Angels and soon became their leader, known as Super Zeus. He led the Angels to a victory over the Demons. But Nadia, seeing how her world is being torn apart by the war, split it in two. Years have passed. You are a young hero named Yamato Ouji, raised in the world of the Angels. Super Zeus sends you on a quest to find other Holy Warriors, to re-unite the worlds, and to bring everlasting peace to all the races.

This is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. You navigate your hero from a top-down view on the world map, in towns, and dungeons. The enemies are random and the combat is turn-based, viewed from first-person perspective. You start alone but later you find other heroes who join your party and help you on your quest.</desc>

	<name>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure [USA]</name>
	<desc>Bill and Ted are two surfer-speaking 1980s high school dudes from San Dimas, California.  After the events of the film Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, they seem free to build the band that will one day unite Earth's people and bring about world peace.  Except...  Rufus returns from the future with a warning that someone has warped the time continuum by kidnapping historical figures and stranding them in the wrong time period (...sooo, basically what Bill and Ted did in the first film?)  It's up to the boys to sort out the mess.

The player controls either Bill or Ted, who have split up to tackle the quest (allowing each to leave items to assist the other). Each "mission" begins by consulting a phone book of historical figures, and spotting the page whose number has changed (a second number, flashing in red).  The player dials that number, and guides the phone booth through the circuits of time. Rufus could only lend a payphone, so players will need to plot out the shortest path to their destination, while avoiding any hazards. Each change in direction costs one coin.

Once in the target time period, the player controls Bill or Ted through an isometric view as they search for the displaced historical figure.  The player must stick to a defined path to avoid falling, and must be cautious of the locals.  Some will offer clues or helpful items, while others demand a coin if bumped into.  Other locals will actively chase Bill and Ted and throw them in jail, where they must use a skeleton key (if they have one) to escape. Players can find and collect coins for the phone booth, keys for the jail, and distractions (like pudding or tape players) to throw off any pursuers.

The player must also locate an item of "historical bait," appropriate to the target, to get them to follow. Once the historical dude has been baited and bagged, the player switches to the other member of the titular duo to rescue a new historical celebrity. The process repeats until time is corrected.</desc>

The penguins start on opposite sides, separated by walls, bricks, and other obstacles. You take control of one of the penguins. The other makes exactly the same movements as you, but in the opposite direction. So if for example you see an enemy to the left of the penguin you are not controlling, you have to fire to the right in order to hit it. You have to reach the top of the level in such a way that the two penguins will arrive at the top square at the same time, coming from opposite sides. Enemies such as spiders will put web on your way or attack you. You can kill them for points. There are various power-ups that appear randomly on the levels. You should also be careful not to run out of time.</desc>

It has to traverse those platform levels to defeat or avoid various enemies. The way the baby deals with the enemies is quite unusual: it inflates them. When inflated, the enemies lose control and begin to float, until they finally explode. The baby can use this to its advantage, riding the enemies while they are floating, kicking them to various directions, making them bounce off walls, using them as projectiles to hit other enemies, etc. Such strategies are necessary when dealing with the bosses you encounter. There are various items scattered through the levels, such as milk, which restores your health completely.</desc>

	<desc>The year is 2081. The Earth has become a devastated planet, overrun by monsters, controlled by a mysterious entity known as Increaser. The only hope to save the beloved Earth lies with you, a young warrior named Dan. You are sent in a time machine to the year 1999, when the monster invasion was beginning. Your task is to find your way through monster-infested labyrinths and to defeat the Increaser  whatever he (or it) is.

The game is an action platformer with more emphasis on exploration than on "jump &amp; run" gameplay. You don't die immediately if a monster touches you, but have a life bar that gets gradually depleted as you are hit. Defeated enemies bring you energy points, which you can spend to buy upgrades. You start with a sword, but later obtain other weapons as well. The game's structure is not entirely linear; many areas have different doors leading to different places.</desc>

	<desc>In The Black Bass you are an angular in a Black Bass fishing tournament. In this tournament, you start out on Lake Amanda as a rating C class angular in 200th position. You must find a good position on the lake to fish as the size, type (fish types: Black Bass, Brown Trout, Rainbow Trout, and Pike), quantity of fish, and obstacles vary depending on were you are on the lake. Once you selected your ideal location, you cast out the lure using a power meter and as you slowly reel it back in. You must try to attract the interested fish by wiggling the lure in the water and if the fish grabs the lure you must reel the fish back in making sure that the line does not snap as well as avoiding any obstacles in the way.

To help you have many lures to choose from (more been unlocked as you progress though the game) as well as a guide to tell you how good you currently selected location is. You have one day in game time to catch the biggest Black Bass you can find as at the end of the day the average weight of you caught Black Bass improves or reduces you rating as well overall position. Your rating determines how far you progress in the tournament unlocking new lakes (lakes: Lake Amada, Japan Lake, Lake More, San Lake).</desc>

	<name>The Black Bass (Japan) [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The objective is for the player to catch as many black bass as possible from sunrise to sunset. The player may select a beginner's game or ranking game. A ranking game requires a password. From here, a player may select a location on the lake to start at and begin fishing. Simply tossing a lure out with the desired power will start the process. A fish can be lured in by moving the lure around and if it bites, then the player can try reeling it in. Too much constant reeling leads to the line breaking and the loss of both the fish and the lure.
Between casting rounds, the player can make certain selections. Among the selections available is the option to change the type and or color of lure being used.</desc>

	<desc>In "Bloody Warriors", you play the role of a nameless young man from an ancient village, which suffers from attacks by a vicious monster. You are assigned to find the monster's lair and to defeat it. However, upon your return to the village you find out some people were abducted by the imperial troops. Now you have to find out the Empries's true motives and to solve a grand mystery.

The gameplay in "Bloody Warriors" is similar to  Dragon Quest series: you travel on the world map, fighting random monsters in turn-based, first-person-perspective battles, and visiting towns and dungeons. The major difference is the addition of strategy battles. At certain points you'll have to recruit knights and to fight whole armies of enemies.</desc>

	<desc>In the 21st century, the evil Emperor Garuda has taken over the city of New York, killing many of its inhabitants. You play as either Hayate or Kaede, two ninjas who are attempting to free the city from Garuda's control.

Shadow of the Ninja is a typical side-scrolling action game, consisting of running, slashing and jumping through 5 levels, each with 4 sub-stages with numerous and varied foes, and a boss enemy at their end.

Kaede and Hayate can not only jump; as ninjas, they can hang from platforms and make swift saltomortals between floors. Sometimes, canisters containing powerups can be found. Typical powerups extend range of the default sword, or they may be additional weapons such as throwing stars and a ninja weapon that looks like a big grappling hook on a string.

The game allowed two players to play cooperatively, a rare feature for action games outside of the Contra series.

	<desc>Bo Jackson was the first all-star athlete in two major sports, Baseball and American Football. Bo Jackson Baseball is a game about Bo Jackson baseball career. This game plays lake a standard baseball nine (or 5  8 if you wish) innings baseball game. There are three difficulty levels giving access to players at all still levels. When pitching you are given 5 different pitch types that pitcher chooses by pressing the correct directional button before the pitch, therefore keeping it hidden from your opponent. Batting is done the same way but the type of hit is chosen as the batter hits the ball.

At any moment, base sneaking can be made (by the batter) or stopped (by the pitcher). Fielding is only done using the CPU, but once the fielder gets the ball then you must choose what base to throw to using the directional buttons. All of the teams are just city names and players, all with different stats, are fictional except for Bo Jackson himself who is hidden in the game.</desc>

	<name>Bokosuka Wars [Japan]</name>
	<desc>King Ogreth of the Basam Empire has invaded your country and either captured or turned into rocks and trees all your soldiers. You, king Suren, are left completely alone. In a desperate attempt, you decide to walk to king Ogreth's castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your soldiers back to you...

In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple  just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.). If king Suren dies in a battle, the game is over - you'll have to start from the beginning no matter how near you were to your goal.</desc>

	<name>Bomber King [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In a desperate measure to combat the overpopulation of Earth, scientists work to create an artificial planet named Altile, named after the scientist who designed it. During the construction of Altile, humanity has become united and peaceful. During this new era of prosperity, Earth decommissions the RoboWarriors, a force of heavily armed half-man half-robot war vehicles. But from another dimension, aliens calling themselves the Xantho Empire and lead by the being Xur invade planet Altile and terraform it for their own uses. The survivors of Altile send out a distress call to Earth. Receiving this message, the people of Earth quickly activate the latest and most powerful of the RoboWarriors, a model known as ZED (Z-Type Earth Defense) and send it at top speed to Altile.

Controlling ZED from an overhead view, the player is able to move in any of 4 directions (up,down,left,right), drop bombs and shoot a projectile weapon. The terrain of Altile is made up of many obstacles and the bombs serve to destroy these and make passage for ZED. Destroying any enemy or obstacle may yield different power-ups which contain any of 10 different effects (including ammunition and energy refills) which may be stocked and used at any time from the menu. Or the power-ups may be instant-use refills for bombs and energy supplies.

Additionally some levels contain keys, which unlock doors and Chalices which prevent the level from running on endlessly. Secret areas such as a Well of Hope and a Room of Idols may also be found. Altogether, there are eight different "worlds" for ZED to conquer, containing numerous stages and guarded by a vicious boss monster.</desc>

	<desc>Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

	<desc>Our hero the white Bomberman (Bomberman Shiro) was walking down the street one day when he witnessed a robbery. It was black Bomberman (Bomberman Kuro) who was the robber. But Black Bomberman knocked White Bomberman to the ground, and than left the money so that he would be framed. Now Bomberman has been taken to jail and must fight his way out of this place using the only method he knows: explosive bombs.

Bomberman is the second Bomberman game in the series and plays similar to the first, only all gameplay has been reduced to a single screen. Your goal however remains the same on a smaller playing area. You are to destroy all enemies on a level and then find the exit to the next one. Bombing the exit is always a bad idea. The occasional power-up will increase your bomb blast, number of bombs on the screen at one time, player speed or give you the ability to walk through walls.

In addition to the single Player game, Bomberman II introduces a Versus Mode for 2 players and a Battle Mode for 3. Your goal in these is to destroy the other players while staying alive yourself.

The game is very similar to every other platform game you have ever played, but it does have its own unique features such as the ability to climb vertical walls with your teeth and do a diving head butt from a jump. Power ups come in the form of lumps of meat and give extra speed and invulnerability in the later stages.

If you have ever played chuck rock then you know what to expect from this, a bog standard platform game with a prehistoric theme.</desc>

The only thing you can do to immobilize the enemies is setting a trap right before they approach you. This gives you an opportunity to gain some valuable time. The enemies will pop out of the traps a few seconds later. The game is divided into levels with increasing difficulty. At each level, your goal is to collect all the treasure before you can proceed. You die if you allow an enemy to touch you.</desc>

Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and attack with a weapon, the most basic of which is a knife. The status display on the screen shows Harker's health bar, countdown timer to complete the level and currently held weapon.  Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario games) can be found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration, timer increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections: the "Daytime" and the "Nighttime". These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss creature who must be defeated to progress.</desc>

	<desc>This is a tetris variant with an adult theme. On the bottom of the play field, a naked woman is bathing, sending up bubbles of different colors. Your task is to arrange those bubbles on the top of the play field in such a way that they create a line of several bubbles of the same color. When you succeed, the bubbles of the same color will disappear. When the whole play field is filled by bubbles, you lose. There are two types of gameplay (one grants you powerups which allow you to clear quickly a large amount of bubbles), with four stages each. You'll get various mildly erotic scenes after completing the stages, and a "reward" in the end. There is also a two-player mode.</desc>

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

	<desc>Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

	<name>Bubble Bobble : Part 2 [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Cubby and Rubby, descendants of Bub and Bob from the original Bubble Bobble, must rescue their friend Judy, who has been kidnapped by the evil Skull Brothers!

The game plays much like the original game: You use a dinosaur that spits bubbles at their enemies, trapping them until you touch the bubbles to make them pop and defeat the trapped enemies. But Cubby and Rubby have two skills their ancestors did not: by holding down the attack button, they can float upwards - and by releasing it, they'll fire several bubbles at once. They can also pick up special items that increase their points, speed and attack power. This game features 80 levels, all-new enemies, and bonus mini-games.

As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</desc>

Burai Fighter is an arcade shooter with two modes of play.  Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts.

Either way, you'll be armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything onscreen.

	<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.

The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.</desc>

	<desc>B-Wings is based on the popular arcade game Battle Wings. It is a vertically scrolling space shooter that owes its name to the space fighter from  Star Wars movies. You have a wide variety of weapons at your disposal: Fire, Cannons, Jump, Hammer, etc. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Cannon fires powerful and rapid blasts, but you can only shoot directly in front of you; Van covers several directions, but has slow speed; Anti builds a protective shield around you each time you shoot, but its range is very small, and so on. You can change the weapons every time you are killed, before you run out of lives and lose the game. Typically, at the end of a level you'll have to face a boss enemy.</desc>

	<name>Cabal [USA]</name>
	<desc>Cabal is a coin-op conversion of Capcom's arcade game. The mechanics of the game are simple: shoot everything in sight!

The hero (there is a two player mode) runs back and forth along the bottom of the screen, ducking and dodging bullets and grenades from the enemy. The roll maneuver from the arcade was not implemented in the PC version. You return fire by moving a target around the screen which also moves your character, so be careful not to run into a bullet.

The enemies throughout the 5 levels, come thick and fast and there are loads of them, normal foot soldiers, tanks, helicopters and end of level bosses, like submarines and war machines.

Just about everything on the screen can be blown up or shot. There are bonus points to be picked up for destroying buildings and weapons to be picked up from the enemy, such as machine- and shot-guns.</desc>

In the single-player side-scrolling action game the player controls a California Raisin through five stages in an effort to rescue the band and their band's musical notes that were stolen by the gang of jealous musicians. The player walk, jump, climb on vines, moonwalk (by pressing the "select" button) and shoot an unlimited supply of grape jelly beans as projectiles. As was the case with other Capcom games, such as Mega Man and DuckTales, one can play the first four levels in any order that you want, but the final level is only available after you have collected the musical notes from each of the four levels.
The first four levels include The Grape Vine, The Factory, The Maize Maze and The Juicery. The final level takes places in The Clouds. During each level you can collect 'I' icons that give you temporary invincibility, regular black musical notes for bonus points, 'Sunshine' icons to restore your health, and 'Raisinette' icons to give an extra life to the player. One can also locate items by shooting at the thin air or at columns.</desc>

	<name>Captain America and The Avengers [Australia]</name>
	<desc>The Mandarin has knocked out Iron Man and the Vision. This time it is personal.

You play as Captain America or Hawkeye. In the one player mode, you must fight your way through various thugs to rescue Iron Man and the Vision. This game is a side scroller, somewhat reminiscent of Bionic Commando in which you fight through a level then move to an overhead map to decide where to go next. In between levels, Wasp gives you hints.

Captain America's attacks are: when he is standing, shield throw; when he is crouching, punch and when he is jumping, kick. Also, if you push twice in a direction, Cap can do a powerful forward charge with his shield for a short distance.

Hawkeye's attacks are all arrow shots. He can shoot left, right, up, upper-left or upper-right.

If you complete an area with one character then complete it with the other character right away, you can press start to switch between Cap or Hawkeye. This has the advantage that Cap's forward charge is powerful and by grabbing poles, he can then jump to areas Hawkeye cannot.

Hawkeye can shoot enemies or targets too high for Cap to jump up and kick.

In the battle mode, this is a two player, one-on-one battle. Player one chooses from Captain America or Hawkeye (the good guys) and player two chooses from Wizard, Ultron or Crossbones (the bad guys).

You fight each other until one player has won three rounds.</desc>

	<desc>"You are Captain Comic, galactic hero. Your mission is to recover three treasures from the planet Omsoc, which have been stolen away and hidden on the remote planet of Tambi."

Captain Comic is a platformer featuring a huge nonlinear playfield divided into several different terrains. As Comic, you must search throughout Tambi for power ups and items that will aid you in your quest to recover the three treasures. The Captain's main weapon is 'Blastola Cola', a can of drink that allows him to hurl fireballs at his foes. For each can that he finds, an additional fireball can be thrown.

There are many different paths that are available from the start, but without the right item or weapon, it can be impossible to progress through certain paths, or even to commit suicide. It's up to the player to decide the correct route to take, and which places to return to at a later time.</desc>

	<desc>Based on the cartoon series of the same name, Captain Planet and the Planeteers are environmental protectors. Each Planeteer is endowed with a special elemental power which is used to combat pollution, preserve the enviroment and keep everything ship-shape. When the Planeteers powers combine they summon Captain Planet, a superhero Captain Planet, guardian of the Earth, is summoned. The powers of Gaia keep watch over the world, and assign the Planeteers to where they are needed.

Captain Planet and the Planeteers is an action sidescroller game divided into two sections: Inside levels and outside levels. Outside levels usually put the Planeteers in some kind of vehicle which can move in any of eight directions on the screen. The planeteers can use any of their elemental powers, drained from an energy bar: Fire shoots a fireball directly ahead, Water shoots out a water wave, Wind lets loose a defensive air currents, Earth tosses stones out to the earth and Heart calms animal creatures. Touching an enemy or projectile results in instant death. 

Inside levels summon Captain Planet himself, who can punch or turn himself into a swirling version of any of the five elements. Captain Planet can also move/fly in any of eight directions and also can only take one hit before dying. Power-ups can also be found on these levels.</desc>

The Delta Foundation has just finished the development of a cyborg unit which represents a new generation of fighting robots. They want to sell it to the government's department of defense as it would pose a threat to the security of the nation if it is sold to a foreign country. They have asked the president, who is actually an alien from outer space, to consider their offer and respond in one week. The government takes this matter very seriously, and assigns Nova to destroy the Delta Foundation. Unfortunately, the government cannot be involved in the event that something might happen to him.

Power Blade 2 has six stages which involves you running through the level, while killing off enemies and avoiding hazards. At the start, you can choose which stage to start at, but unlike Power Blade, once you have chosen a stage, you can't exit and choose another one until you have completed the current one first. Nearly each stage involves you using your wits, as you dodge spikes, jumping towards the top of the screen to avoid fire, and getting fans to lift you onto platforms. You can also slide your way through tight spots, as long as you slide in the right place.

At the end of each stage, you fight a different boss. However, in the end, you must fight all the bosses you fought before before you get to fight the alien leader.

	<name>Captain Silver [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In Captain Silver, you play the role of Jim, a brave young lad with a taste of adventure. You embark on a journey to find Captain Silver's secret treasure hoard, which is rumored to be hidden on an island in the Eastern Seas.

There are six scenes in the game. During his travels, Jim will explore villages, fight his way on board ships, venture through caves, and wander around tropical islands. In each of these six scenes, Jim must use his sword to kill cats, rats, bats, witches, skeletons, and other creatures that are waiting for him. When Jim touches, or is shot at, by a creature, he loses one of his lives, but when he kills a creature, he can collect some gold that they leave behind, which can be used to buy items from shops. However, rather than getting gold, enemies leave behind some gold containing one of the letters that spell the word "CAPTAIN SILVER". If Jim manages to get all of these letters, he will be awarded an extra life.

Jim may only use his sword to start off with, but once he collects a fairy that floats toward him in every scene, Jim will be able to shoot stars at enemies, making his kills more efficient. The maximum number of stars that he can have is six. There are other power-ups that Jim can collect in the game. These include the "clock" power-up, which gives Jim extra time; the "boot" power-up which allows Jim to jump higher; and the "coffee?" power-up, which enables Jim to shield himself from creatures until he is hit by one.

There is a boss in each scene, which he must defeat in order to proceed to the next round. There is also a certain time limit, which Jim must complete the scene before it expires. If he does not, then he will lose a life.</desc>

	<name>Castlevania II : Simon's Quest [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Castlevania II: Simon's Quest is the second one of three Castlevania games released on the NES. After the vampire killer Simon Belmont destroyed Count Dracula in the original Castlevania (1987), an evil curse possessed him. The only way Simon can break the count's curse is to find five of Dracula's body parts (which are mysteriously strewn throughout Transylvania) and burn them. 

Unlike most of the other Castlevania games, Simon's Quest does not feature the traditional stages but allows you to freely roam the land of Transylvania in the style of Nintendo's Metroid. In several towns Simon can talk with NPC's and buy items in shops, adding a touch of role-playing.

	<name>Castlevania II : Simon's Quest [USA]</name>
	<desc>Castlevania II: Simon's Quest is the second one of three Castlevania games released on the NES. After the vampire killer Simon Belmont destroyed Count Dracula in the original Castlevania (1987), an evil curse possessed him. The only way Simon can break the count's curse is to find five of Dracula's body parts (which are mysteriously strewn throughout Transylvania) and burn them. 

Unlike most of the other Castlevania games, Simon's Quest does not feature the traditional stages but allows you to freely roam the land of Transylvania in the style of Nintendo's Metroid. In several towns Simon can talk with NPC's and buy items in shops, adding a touch of role-playing.

	<name>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Edoropolis is home to a race of Animaloids, anthropomorphic animals which are a combination of flesh and cybernetic body parts. They are ruled by Shogun Tokugawa Lei Lei and his daughter, Tokugawa Usako. Unfortunately for them, the Prime Minister Kitsunezuka Ko'on No Kami is actively trying to depose both of them and wants to assume power by force! He's always got a plan up his sleeves, usually involving attacking the city using an army of Ninja Crows, led by Karamaru and Karasu Gennarisai (who also serves as Ko'on No Kami's advisor).

It's here where Inuyama Wanko-no-Kami, Chief of the Palace guard, steps in - by bringing in the Secret Ninja Team Nyankii! Whenever Wanko-No-Kami hears that Ko'on No Kami is plotting something, he dispatches the Nyankiis from their secret base at the Pizza Cat Restaurant so they can stop him before he is successful.

However, there are rumors that a foreign scientist called Dr. Purple is aiding Ko'on No Kami... but for what purpose? What could Ko'on No Kami be planning this time?

Kyatto Ninden Teyandee is a side-scrolling action game in the tradition of Ninja Gaiden, and it is based off the Japanese TV show produced in 1990 by Tatsunoko Productions and Sotsu agency. There are eleven stages in total, and you can play as any of the three main Secret Ninja Team Nyankii members: Yattaro, leader of the team, who uses his Cat's Eye Sword as his main weapon; Pururun, the only female on the team, who attacks with projectiles and her razor-sharp nails; and Sukashii, who uses an umbrella to dispatch his enemies.

By pausing the game, you can switch out and change places with one of the four Rescue Team members in order to use their special abilities: Rikinoshin can break boulders, Mietoru can fly for a limited time, Gotton can drill through certain walls, and Nekkii can swim easily and use water attacks. You can only use their abilities for a limited amount of time, which can be recovered by picking up items with a cat paw printed on it.

All seven playable characters have an upgradable special move, which can be used by pressing Up + B. Each move is more devastating than the last, but can only be used a certain amount of times, until the Ninpo bar is drained.</desc>

	<desc>This game is the predecessor of Bubble Bobble and it's
a platform game where a roundish yellow creature, named Chack'n, must fight against Monstas and Mightas. The Monstas hatch from eggs at the ceilings and the Mightas push a rock that is used as the game's timer.
The eggs have three phases:  if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an eggs turns red it will pop almost immediately.
Chack'n uses bombs to release the en-caged hearts and to blow up the Monstas. When the heart is released it will fly up and destroy the separator block between the level and the Mighta. Go to the Mighta and you are in the next level.
After 14 levels there's a wedding between Mr. and Mrs. Chack'n.</desc>

	<name>Challenger [Japan]</name>
	<desc>One of Hudson Soft's earliest NES titles, Challenger is an arcade-style game that combines side scrolling, run 'n jump action with overhead, exploratory gameplay. The game consists of two parts.

The first level (or "scene") has you racing the clock to get to the front of a train, where a purple-faced villain is holding your significant other (or, perhaps just some anonymous princess). You have at your disposal a trusty throwing knife to take care of enemies. You will also have to dodge obstacles and jump gaps in the train. This section is taken from the earlier Hudson game, Stop the Express.

Scene 2 places you in an overhead, maze-like environment, where you once again have to fight the clock. This time though, you have to navigate your way through the area, in search of all the different "keywords", which are placed in different caves. Once you have cleared all the caves, the path will be open to the boss' final lair.</desc>

	<name>Championship Pool [USA]</name>
	<desc>Championship Pool is a pool game where players can 8-ball or 9-ball pool tournament that starts off with the BCA Regional Championship where the player must defeat 32 opponents in a first to four games match. If the player loses against any of the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto the World Championship.

All of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes. 

There are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:

1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship. During the tournament the opponent is never actually is seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the player with a caption and then returns the control to the player with some balls removed and moved. This way the opponent can finish the game within 4 turns regardless of if they where snookered or not.

2. Challenge:  It has many different pool games that are played, all with one player without an opponent. The games are:

1. 14.1 Challenge  After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. At that point, the player can hit any ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole the game is over. If there is only one ball left on the table the rest of the balls are re-racked and play continues. At the end score is given based on the number of balls that where hit in the holes. The score are tallied up over 5 games to get the total score.

2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit all the chosen set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball in one turn.  The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

3. Nine Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one turn. The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

4. Equal Offence  Same as 14.1 Challenge but there is only one game played.

5. Three Pool  Only have 3 balls on the table. Score is based on how many shots it takes to get all three balls in with lower been better.

6. Speed Pool  Objective is to hit all the balls in as quickly as possible as a timer is timing how long the game takes. Any ball can be hit at any time and the player can miss the shot and not be penalised (other than taking longer).

3. Party:  It has many different multiplayer pool games that are played with ether just 2 or 2 to 8 human players. The games are:

1. Eight Ball (2 Players)   A standard eight ball game with the players taking turns to play.

8. 14.1 Continuous (2 Players)   Players can hit any ball in for a point. If a shot is missed then other player plays. If there is only one ball on the table the pocketed balls are re-racked. Play continues until one of the players reaches the score chosen at the start of the game.

9. Ten Ball (2-8 Players)   Same as Nine Ball except with 10 balls.

10. Rotation (2-8 Players)   Only the lowest ball can be hit and the score for getting a ball in is the value of the ball (e.g. 8-ball is 8 points). Player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

11. Straight Pool (2 Players)    Same as 14.1 Continuous but the player with the highest score after one game wins.

12. Equal Offence (2-8 Players)    Same as Equal Offence in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each others score.

13. Fifteen Ball (2-8 Players)   Same as Rotation except that any ball can be hit not just the lowest.

14. One Pocket (2 Players)   The two players are given one of the two pockets at the end of the table. The player must hit all the balls in there nominated pocket with the one with the most balls wins.

  
Three Ball (2-8 Players)   Same as Three Ball in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each others score.

	<desc>Episode II:
Once upon a time there was the kingdom of Guldred, that had been reigned by Gulse I. All his glory brought peace and joy to people.One day, the assassination of Gulse I changed the land of peace into the battleground. That was plotted by General Guemon. It was the critical moment of the Guldred kingdom.
Under the circumstances, Gazem, an old knight advised Queen Liza and Princess Karen to ask Backviser for help. Backviser was King Gulse's old friend, who lived in the island of Chester Field. Liza and Karen decided to go there with Gazem.
On their way to the island, unfortunately, their ship was attacked by Guemon's men. Gazem fought bravely against the pirates in vain; he got badly wounded and Liza was killed, and what is worse, Princess Karen was imprisoned somewhere in the island of Chester Field.
The wounded knight drifted to the island, where he was treated by a young man named Kein. Gazem, however, breathed his last and after he told Kein all of his story.
Deeply moved by his story, Kein decided to go on a journey to reconstruct the Guldred kingdom. He had to rescue Princess Karen from the hand of the enemy and to fight against Guemon.
And then, the story of the young knight was beginning with the island of Chester Field....</desc>

	<desc>Despite what the name implies, Wacky Races for NES is not a racing game, and has nothing to do with the other games bearing the same name but the license. In this game, the player takes control of Muttley, the grumbling, but loyal dog from the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon. His master Dastardly sends his on three different missions, each taking place in a different location, which in its turn is divided into smaller levels. 

Muttley has to complete those levels in a rather standard platformer fashion, moving from left to right, jumping, overcoming obstacles and fighting various creatures and boss enemies from the cartoon movie. The dog's primary weapon is, unsurprisingly, his own mouth - biting regular enemies will usually lead to their instant death. Muttley can also collect bones scattered across the levels, which will grant him powerful weapons and skills of limited use, such as a bomb, a projectile attack, and the ability to heal.</desc>

	<name>Chip 'N Dale : Rescue Rangers 2 [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Following the first Rescue Rangers game, the Rangers' overcame the plot of their arch-nemesis Fatcat, and locked him up in the prison/pound. However, Fatcat's henchmen have sprung him from prison by blimp. Suddenly a television news anchor is reporting that there is a bomb threat in a local restaurant. The Rescue Rangers take it upon themselves to save the day only to learn that the whole bomb scare was a diversion in order to allow Fatcat to steal an artifact known as the Urn of the Pharoah. The team must track Fatcat and learn what he has in store for the stolen goods.

Like the previous game, Chip &amp; Dale's Rescue Rangers 2 is a side-scrolling action game where 2 players can play simultaneously as Chip &amp; Dale, or 1 player can control either chipmunk. Our heroes must conquer a series of oversized (from their perspective) stages in order to thwart Fatcat's nefarious schemes. For example, the first stage has the chipmunks hopping across the tables, chairs, and counters of a restaurant, and on through the kitchen. Many enemies try to slow the player's progress. The chipmunks' offensive ability is to pick up any of the copious blocks that litter the landscape and toss it in any of 5 directions (sideways, up, and diagonal-up). Along the way, there are scattered RR blocks for the heroes to collect. The other members of the Rescue Rangers -- Monty, Gadget, and Zipper -- are on hand to lend help out at key junctures.

	<desc>The rescue rangers are tiny heroes. Consisting of two chipmunks, two mice and a fly... these heroes may be small but there's no case too big for them to take on. This game starts out simply enough, with a mission to rescue a small kitten, but soon escalates into a wider plot that pits the rescue rangers against their arch-nemesis, the feline kingpin, Fat Cat.

	<name>Chip to Dale no Daisakusen 2 [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Following the first Rescue Rangers game, the Rangers' overcame the plot of their arch-nemesis Fatcat, and locked him up in the prison/pound. However, Fatcat's henchmen have sprung him from prison by blimp. Suddenly a television news anchor is reporting that there is a bomb threat in a local restaurant. The Rescue Rangers take it upon themselves to save the day only to learn that the whole bomb scare was a diversion in order to allow Fatcat to steal an artifact known as the Urn of the Pharoah. The team must track Fatcat and learn what he has in store for the stolen goods.

Like the previous game, Chip &amp; Dale's Rescue Rangers 2 is a side-scrolling action game where 2 players can play simultaneously as Chip &amp; Dale, or 1 player can control either chipmunk. Our heroes must conquer a series of oversized (from their perspective) stages in order to thwart Fatcat's nefarious schemes. For example, the first stage has the chipmunks hopping across the tables, chairs, and counters of a restaurant, and on through the kitchen. Many enemies try to slow the player's progress. The chipmunks' offensive ability is to pick up any of the copious blocks that litter the landscape and toss it in any of 5 directions (sideways, up, and diagonal-up). Along the way, there are scattered RR blocks for the heroes to collect. The other members of the Rescue Rangers -- Monty, Gadget, and Zipper -- are on hand to lend help out at key junctures.

As the manager you build up your team by allocating a set bunch of points for batting average, home runs, running speed, and fielding ability among your players. Then, you customize your pitching staff by divvying up points for ERA, speed, right and left curve balls, sinking pitches, and stamina. Your managerial responsibilities also include deciding who's right-handed and who's a lefty, and whether your pitchers throw overhand or sidearm.

You can also play in the Ultra League. Ultra League play enables you to give your hitters and pitchers special skills, such as the ability to pitch balls that zig zag, or hit balls that explode on contact.</desc>

Before the player selects a stage, they have to select one of five heroes, each with their own amount of health and weapon type. They also have a limited use special attack that can clear the screen of enemies. At the end of each level the hero jumps inside a giant robot and engages in a one-on-one duel with the boss of that level. 

The game features four difficulty levels (2 hidden),  a password system, and a "Battle mode" in which the player can practice fighting against any of the bosses.

	<desc>An evil leader and his gang of bio-engineered monsters has taken over the land and only one man stands in their way. Only he's not a man, he is a lycanthrope, a person able to transform into a terrible werewolf to let loose his anger.

You start the game in human form. The human can punch, jump, move and shoot a powered up shot which moves horizontally across the screen.  By finding a Red "W" icon, the human is able to transform into a mighty werewolf creature. Accidentally grabbing a blue "W" icon or losing too much energy will change you back into a mere human being. The werewolf form offers higher jumps, quicker speed, greater strength, a shockwave attack and the ability to climb walls, so naturally you'll want this form whenever possible.  Additionally the werewolf form has an anger meter that is augmented by collecting orbs. After 5 such orbs, the werewolf will transform yet again into a SUPER werewolf with even greater strength, speed and partial invincibility.

There are 5 stages in all. Each with a boss who moves in a distinct pattern.</desc>

	<desc>You are Charlie, a member of a circus troupe. Your job is to please the crowd by performing five death-defying stunts:

Stunt #1: You and the lion must jump through several rings of fire. Remember to avoid the jugs that emit fire. You must do this for 100 meters.

Stunt #2: Walk the tightrope for 70 meters, avoiding the monkeys that get in your way. Jump the cyan monkeys for 500 points.

Stunt #3: Roll on a ball for 80 meters, jumping from ball to ball. You can move balls backwards if the target is too close to make a successful jump. Avoid contact with the ground.

Stunt #4: Ride a horse for 200 meters, bouncing on trampolines along the way. Be careful not to miss the jump or go over the tops of trampolines. You can speed up or slow down the horse.

Stunt #5: Finally, trapeze from swing to swing for 50 meters. If you miss, make sure that you land on the platforms below so you bounce back on a swing.

Once you have completed all five stunts, you have to do them again and hopefully, more points will be awarded.</desc>

	<desc>Professor Plum and his designs for the "doomsday device", DEAD END have been taken by the diabolical LAWBREAKERS - a sinister group dedicated to the destruction of mankind. It's only a matter of time before the device is assembled and the final countdown begins. 
As Sergeant Billy "Big Bang" Blitz of the special Assault Brigade for Real Emergencies(S.A.B.R.E) your mission is to foil the LAWBREAKERS plan. To do this, you must find the shortest route to the summit of Demonhead mountain, where the professor is being held. Rescue the professor and save the world from total destruction. 
This is a "typical" sidescroller with Role playing elements. the various enemies you meet with leave behind cash which can then be used to buy equipment. You'll need a diving suit to swim underwater, a jetpack to get to those hard to reach areas and don't forget the shop card that can be used to call the shop no matter where you are.</desc>

	<name>Classic Concentration [USA]</name>
	<desc>Concentration was a popular game show in the mid-to-late 1980s, and this game was adapted from that television program.

Two players can play against each other, or one person can play against a computer generated opponent. The answer to the puzzle is hidden by tiles. The tiles have words denoting game prizes ("Mexico", "Camera", "Telescope", for example), and your object is to find the two matching worded tiles. Exposing two at a time, your memory is taxed as more prize tiles are revealed and then covered over again.  As more tiles are matched, the hidden puzzle is revealed. Solve the puzzle and you win the game.</desc>

	<desc>Cliffhanger is based on the 1993 Sylvester Stallone movie. The lead character, Gabe Walker, is an expert in high mountain search and rescue and receives a distress signal from a plane that has crashed nearby. However, the plane is actually loaded with terrorists who hijacked a large shipment of cash. The game consists of side-scrolling action. The hero can walk, run, jump, punch, and kick while jumping. Further, he can perform special feats as the situation requires, such as crossing a rope suspended from 2 cliffs. One of the biggest threats in this game is nature as Gabe must defend against wolves and birds, snow falling off cliffs and structures, and falling rocks.</desc>

	<name>Cobra Triangle [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Cobra Triangle is a single-player boat-racing game that lets you do more than race. It borrows the power-up system from the shoot 'em up genre but keeps the emphasis more on maneuvering than shooting. Since you have a health meter with a dozen bars in it, it's not that important to dodge bullets unless your health is really low, but you should try not to run into too many walls. In order to get very far you need to make use of your power-ups which are TURBO for better acceleration; FIRE for increased firepower; SPEED for increased top-speed; MISSILE for firing missiles as well as bullets; and FORCE which makes you fire tons of missiles and also makes you invincible for a limited time. You get roughly one minute to complete each level. Speaking of which, there are 7 types of levels each with a different objective:

(1) Race to the Finish - Shoot other boats along the way to the finish line and avoid enemies like turrets and sharks. Some boats tow power-up pods behind them that you can collect after you shoot them. It doesn't matter when you finish, and you aren't told if you get 1st or 2nd or 3rd place... it seems that the other boats are only there to get in your way. Watch for the fork in the river; choosing alternate paths takes you to the same levels of the game but in a different order.

(2) Collect the Pods - Simply race in a straight path while running over ramps to collect pods and 1UP's in the air. You go on to the next level when time runs out.

(3) Dispose of Mines - There is a small square in the water with mines in it. You actually have to collect the mines and tow them to another square to make them explode. Of course, there is an invincible enemy boat that tries to steal them back from you and some guys that shoot at you. It takes awhile since you can only tow them one at a time.

(4) Fry the Monster - The 'boss' levels. You fight a sea-serpent, a crab, a shark, etc. He has his own health display right above yours, but it tends to deplete slower.
(BONUS) Shoot the Targets - after every boss level you go to an auto-scrolling level where you are rewarded with a 1UP prize if you manage to shoot all the targets along the shore without missing any.

(5) Guard the People - There's a large square filled with 8 helpless swimmers, and for some reason they're all about to be kidnapped. Other boats race into the square and tow them away unless you destroy their ships before they get away. You can tow the people back into the square-if you have time-while avoiding the spaceships that fire stunning missiles at you. If you have at least one swimmer left when the timer runs out then you pass.

(6) Reach the Finish - Race in a straight course with plenty of obstacles but no other boats. You drive upstream while the current drags a horde of logs and whirlpools in your direction to stop you. Occasionally some planes fly by and shoot at you. If you happen to die in this or any other level, you simply reappear on the spot as long as you have an extra life. A continue puts you back at the beginning of the level you were on.

(7) Jump the Waterfall - A level that consists of a series of moving ramps you must use to jump over huge pits. Moving currents, whirlpools, and the violation of several laws of physics makes this more difficult than it sounds.

The entire game consists of repeating these types of levels for a grand total of 25 stages. The later stages are much more difficult than the first. They're filled with additional obstacles like icebergs, more mines, more enemies, and longer courses. There are even speed-ramps that let you take small short-cuts in later racing levels.</desc>

But things quickly become more complicated and the player soon has to rescue other characters along the way, such as Santa Claus, the king of Trump castle and the blue fairy Cocoron. Tapir can manipulate people's dreams and this ability gives Cocoron an unique twist - the player can assemble his own character by combining one of the eight available heads to one of the eight available bodies (which both include several designs to choose from, resulting in literally hundreds of combinations! ). More than a mere physical appearance, each part also defines the character's attributes, such as his health, speed, how high he can jump and so forth.</desc>

	<name>Columbus - Ougon no Yoake [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In "Columbus: Ougon no Yoake" you take control of young Columbus, who is dreaming to sail the seas and explore the world. You start at the age of 14, becoming a apprentice aboard an old ship, where you learn the basics of combat. Your ultimate goal in this role-playing-game is to discover the continent America, just like the original model Christoph Kolumbus.
The Game can be played in two different modes. Either in "Normal Mode" or in "Historical Mode". The only difference of the historical mode compared to the normal mode, is that you have a limited ammount of time to complete the game. You start in December of 1465 and the game then ends by the end of 1492. The time ticks off, based on the number of steps you take, what means that you'll want to keep your steps as low as possible.
Discover the new world and take your place in history!</desc>

Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</desc>

	<name>Conflict [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Conflict is a turn-based, hex-grid wargame for the NES that can be played by one or two players.  It is not a strictly historical wargame in which battles of the past are recreated using real-world geography.  Instead, the two opposing sides (Blue vs. Red) fight it out across 16 imaginary scenarios with armies modeled on NATO and Warsaw Pact forces of the late 1980s. 

The game alternates between two modes of play: a strategic/operational scale, in which players move their units around the hex map; and a tactical combat module for resolving unit-to-unit combats.  In the tactical mode, human players have the choice of either issuing orders themselves or using the &amp;quot;auto&amp;quot; mode which delegates command to the AI.
Splash graphics and text messages convey battle results.

By capturing towns and winning battles, the player gains &amp;quot;fame&amp;quot; points that can be used to purchase more and better military hardware.  Every scenario ends only when the same, single victory condition is achieved by one of the two sides: destroy the opposing side's main battle tank unit in combat.

Winning any one of the first 15 scenarios yields a letter of the alphabet; together, the letters spell out the password that must be entered in order to play the final scenario.</desc>

	<name>Conquest Of The Crystal Palace [USA]</name>
	<desc>Long ago the Crystal Palace was a thriving kingdom, however the evil war spirit Zaras appeared one day and brought destruction to the lands! The people of the Crystal Palace left as Zaras and his henchman took over, changing the kingdom into a maze of many dangers. You control Farron, the hero of the story who needs to enter the Crystal Palace and destroy the bad guys in order to restore peace. The game is an action platform game that scrolls both horizontally and vertically. On each of five stages you'll need to fight various enemies throughout the varied terrain, and finally defeat the boss at the end. You'll start with just a simple sword, but additional weapons can be found or bought in order to help you out. If you get into trouble, you can also call your dog Zap onto the screen; he'll jump around causing damage to the enemies giving you a chance to escape. You may also come across Kim's shops along your journey. Here you can buy various items, including additional  lives, replenish your health, more powerful weapons, and other useful items. To purchase items, you'll need money which can be collected after defeating enemies in battle.</desc>

	<desc>Race America is a 2-car cross-country racing game. Either 2 players can compete on the same screen, or the computer can control the second player. The game provides eight colorful opponents to race against, each of whom is supposed to have distinct advantages in a race. Each race begins from a side-scrolling perspective as the 2 competitors speed out of the gate. After a certain distance, the perspective shifts to third person and the driver in the lead occupies the top half of the screen while the driver in second is relegated to half of the lower screen. Occasionally, the game also employs an overhead view. To add to the challenge, the game's cars have 6-speed manual transmissions which players must shift using the control pad, but not while pressing the gas button.</desc>

	<desc>Cosmic Wars takes you back to the Gradius universe as the 650-year long alliance between the Gradius empire and the Bacterions shatters and war breaks out again. The difference this time is that instead of fighting from the cockpit of your Vic-Viper starfighter you'll now be taking the commander's chair and take strategic control of your entire fleet.

The game is a turn-based strategy game in which you must first assemble your armada and then take them into outer space to defeat the enemy fleet. You view the action from a top-down galactic map and success in each phase rewards you with further cash which you can use to buy more ships. The game will continue until the enemy fleet is obliterated (or yours).

The game doesn't include a campaign, but instead provides you with a scenario designer from which you select the AI difficulty, which side you will take (you can play as either the Gradius empire or the Bacterions) the map you'll play and away you go. Features single or 2-player Vs gameplay.</desc>

Star Voyager's gameplay requires the player to venture through various sectors of the galaxy in search of different alien fleets so they can be defeated. Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade the player's equipment to fight off the enemy fleets. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship's warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If players do not warp to different sectors wisely, they might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.</desc>

	<desc>In this game you play the role of a young gunslinger who travels the land fighting baddies and playing mini games. The main game play involves you moving around the towns horizontally collecting gold by hitting chest whilst at the same time killing the bad guys before they kill you. There is also an RPG element to it where you have to visit people in the towns in order to proceed like at the very beginning where you need to first acquire a knife and you are then able to smash the chest and get money in order to buy a key which in turn allows you to enter the Sheriffs building. Once you are made sheriff you can go to various towns hunting down an outlaw for the bounty money. There are also mini-games such as the shooting range where you have to shoot the bad guy targets whilst avoiding shooting the innocent bystander targets.</desc>

	<name>Crackout [Europe]</name>
	<desc>In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.

But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.

There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.

Crackout is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.</desc>

	<name>Crash'n the Boys Street Challenge [USA]</name>
	<desc>Another tournament composed of several different challenges rocks the streets near Nekketsu High and since the series hero Kunio isn't going to turn down a challenge anytime soon, every gang in the city sends its team hoping to come up on top.

Crash 'N the Boys: Street Challenge features the same basic gameplay engine and mechanics found in the rest of the Kunio/Nekketsu High games. The player controls a character in side-scrolling levels and try to defeat opponents using an arsenal of attacks and special moves. Unique to this game is that in order to clear the five stages, the player must also accomplish a series of sport-themed objectives. There is a throwing event, a golfing event, swimming, jumping, and all-out fighting events, all with unique twists inspired by the street/gangs theme of the game (e.g. the jumping event involves jumping across the rooftops in the city).

Depending on the player's performance in each event they may earn medals that can be exchanged for power-ups and stat increases. The game supports two players co-op or vs. gameplay.

	<name>Crazy Climber [Japan]</name>
	<desc>As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</desc>

	<name>Crisis Force [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The year is 199x and a robot army has invaded Tokyo City. A boy and a girl (who remain unnamed) board their ships to fight off the threat.

This is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up game viewed from overhead, where the player pilots a fighter ship through seven levels of intense shooting action. Each level hurls enemies and bullets at the player's ship, ending with a boss fight, except for one which instead is a boss rush level. The game allows for two players to play at the same time.

The player has a choice of two weapons; bullets or lasers. Weapons can be changed by picking up gems of different colors. Picking up the same color as you already have allows you to upgrade your current weapon a few times. The player's ship can change form and with it the way that the weapons work. This allows the player to pick the best weapon strategy for each situation. The player also has a limited amount of bombs that are useful to get out of tricky situations.

When a weapon is upgraded it also acts as a shield so the ship can take an enemy bullet without dying. This will however degrade the weapon down to the first level again. There are also pickups that alter the ship's speed and a special gem that, if five of them are collected, temporarily transforms the ship into an invincible super ship.

Using the robot you need to locate your quota of crystals while avoiding the many dangers present in the mines, including lava, rock slides, and unfriendly creatures. The robot is equipped with explosives to help reach remote locations in the mine, or destroy any creatures getting in the way (be careful with explosives, you could set off a rock slide and crush the robot!) Once your crystal quota is met, quickly locate the exit and move on to the next, more challenging mine. Crystal Mines is part action and part strategy. There is a time limit to locate the crystals in each mine, plus avoiding falling rocks and monsters will keep you on your toes, but before long you will need to figure out how to locate crystals by properly removing obstructions and navigating tricky mazes.</desc>

	<name>Base Wars [USA]</name>
	<desc>In the 24th century, the game of Baseball is very different. Tired of paying huge players salaries, the team owners got together one weekend and came up with a bold new idea, Robots. Indeed they renamed their league the Cyber League and stocked it with four robot types; Cyborg, Tank, Floater or Motorcycle, to play.  On an orbital stadium in space, these robots all play a slightly different variation of the baseball rules. Hitting the ball and catching pop-flys and making home runs are all the same, but when the call of a play is in dispute, there are no base referees; the robots engage in a one-on-one battle using any weaponry they're carrying.  Of course to make things interesting, weaponry (and other robot parts and equipment) can only be purchased with team funds during a tournament game, and team funds can only be obtained by wins. Thus the series closer is always sure to be a sold out game.

	<name>Cyberball [USA]</name>
	<desc>After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.

Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.

Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives</desc>

The bomb will explode taking you with it should you take too long to get past all the obstacles on the screen. You start the game with nine ships, and more can be earned by collecting enough points during the game.

	<desc>The Franco family used to be one of the influential houses of Portugal. That is until the head of the family sailed out of a disastrous voyage to find the kingdom of Prester John. The disarray that followed brought about an end to the nobility of the Franco name. 100 years have passed and Portugal has prospered through it's sailing and trading empires. Young Leon Fanco wishes to restore his family's good name and make a name for himself as a sailor. At the heart of his ambition is the fair lady, Christiana, who is desired by the likely heir to the kingdom. Towards that end, Leon has been working hard to secure finances for his first ship. With the first step of his dream complete, Franco sails out with his father's good friend as first mate, you're off to find fame, adventure and fortunes out on the sea and in uncharted waters.

Uncharted Waters is a sailing and trading simulation. Your goal is initially to sail between ports and trade goods between them to make a profit. Along the way, you may be called upon by merchants and royalty to do specific tasks. Several different nations as well as pirates roam the sea and not all have good relations with one another. You can take as long as you want and explore as much of the world as possible to complete your ultimate task of marrying Christiana, which will require your fame rating to be quite high anyway. Available at most ports is a trader for cargo, a supply station for your crew's food and water as well as repairs, a shipbuilder, an item store and finally a pub for gaining information, crew and gambling.

All of the game progresses on an overhead-view, by sea you navigate your fleet by direction and can issue additional orders including landing on any piece of land to search for supplies. A variety of hazards live at sea including storms, other ships, seaweed and simply bad winds and currents.</desc>

	<desc>In the peaceful town of Carpentersville, some workers known as The Rusty Nailers decide to bulldoze a house that belongs to Harry. Harry is certainly not happy with this, and goes on a rampage, destroying workers that get in his way. As Harry, you can destroy workers in one of two ways: you can smash them when one of them gets near them, or you can pound the ground, and by doing this, you will send shockwaves in both directions. 

There are four environments in which Harry needs to get through: construction sites, sewer, ship, and the mansion where Harry meets the leader who ordered the demolition of his house. At the end of each environment, a boss needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next environment. In between these, there are bonus stages in which you have to destroy a number of enemies before time runs out.</desc>

	<name>Dance Aerobics [USA]</name>
	<desc>Dance Aerobics is a chance to get fit by following the movements of an aerobics instructor.

Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4 by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.

The second mode is mini-games called Pad Antics that includes Tune Up, Mat Melodies, and Ditto. Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80 points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song.  Ditto is like a one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every successful position.

The third mode is Aerobics Studios.  Aerobics Studios is the same as the main game but with only 4 levels (Studio 5,  Studio 10, Studio 15, and Studio 20) all unlocked at the start, a score that counts down from 100 with mistakes (or up if the player is doing well), no progression in levels, and the player can continue playing even if there score is at 0.</desc>

	<desc>Danny Sullivan, 1988 IndyCar champion and winner of the classic 'Spin &amp; Win' Indianapolis 500 in 1985, put his name to this Super Sprint style racing game. There are 4 cars in each race, 1 or 2 player options, and 9 tracks to race on, with the Tradewest Speed Bowl the ultimate target, and is much longer but with double points (it's essentially a substitute for the licensed-elsewhere Indianapolis 500, which did pay double the usual level of IndyCar championship points for many years).

The player has limited fuel, and will run slowly if supplies run out, and the car can be damaged, although both are repairable in the pits. They get a turbo to use sparingly, which can also be recharged in the pits if they have bought more. After each race the player will get money (slightly more for a higher finish), which can be spent on upgrades such as improved power, brakes or more turbos.</desc>

	<desc>You are Dash Galaxy, a fearless space explorer. You have just landed on a strange, alien planet thousands of light years from Earth. Your mission is to make your way though the maze of rooms and return safely to your ship. To do this you will need to enter every room and collect all of the objects that can be found in it. Your oxygen supply is limited, though, so be sure to hurry! Throughout this world there are many aliens which will deplete your oxygen even faster if you come into contact with them. Occasionally you will find bombs or keys which can be used to reach previously inaccessable rooms on a floor. The game is played from two points of view; top down when in an elevator shaft, or side scrolling when in one of the many rooms. Some levels contain hidden rooms with many bonuses, or even an express elevator to get you to your destination faster (or it might take you back down a few levels.)</desc>

The player controls a motorcycle and must cross the finish line before an established number of competitor bikes. The player must avoid crashing into obstacles, opposing racers, vehicles, and running out of gas. During a race there are certain areas where the player can refill their gas but stopping to refuel will cause competitor bikes to take advantage and race past the player. Competitors never run out of fuel but they are able to crash into obstacles thus taking them out of the race.

Occasionally during a race a helicopter will fly by dropping items that the player is able to pick up. The items are a 1000 Points Bonus, helper motorcycles that help you crash other racers, extra gasoline, Hi-grade gasoline which lasts longer than normal, a   turbocharger that gives extra speed, and a helmet which provides  invincibility.

If the player places in the top ten in a race, they are able to tune up their bike with better equipment. The player can upgrade their bike's engine (either 2 cycle type or 4 cycle type) and its tires(either rain, brock, or stick).</desc>

	<desc>Dragon Ball Z: Gekito Tenkaichi Budokai, Doragon Boru Zetto Gekit? Tenkaichi Budokai; translated as "Dragon Ball Z: A Fierce Battle at the Tenkaichi Budoukai") is the first fighting video game based on Dragon Ball Z. The game was unique in that it came with a special card reader attachment for the NES, the Datach Joint Rom System, which requires several special cards to be swiped in order to add characters and items in the game.
The game features many playable characters from the series (at least 28) and most of their transformations, with a corresponding trading card for each. There is also cards for varying versions of each single character, all with completely different attributes, statistics, and usable special moves. Each single version of a single character has only one special attack</desc>

	<desc>The enemy is unstoppable. They maintain vigilant guard over their front lines! The only way to defeat them is to get behind their lines. But how? By allowing a soldier to get captured, perhaps he could escape and single-handedly defeat the enemy forces in his way. 

In P.O.W., the player is a soldier who has been imprisoned in a Prisoner of War camp and must escape. In order to accomplish this, he must defeat a variety of enemies.  The foes will attack you hand-to-hand, with knives, guns, and from helicopters. Boss enemies will guard the end of each level.

To fight back, you can use hand-to-hand, and pick up weapon power-ups, found on the ground, in rooms, or dropped by enemies. These weapons include a knife, which can be used to stab or be thrown, guns and grenades.

During a day at school, he runs into events that will cause him to escape into his fantasy world, which in game terms equates to the levels you will be playing through. The fantasy lands include treks through the middle ages, the wild west, ancient Rome, and Mount Olympus (some of these levels will be revisited throughout the game). Your weapons are level specific such as a sword and lance in the medieval level and a gun and whip in the wild west level.

	<desc>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</desc>

	<name>Death Race [USA] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>Death Race is seemingly inspired by the Sylvester Stallone movie Death Race 2000 released 15 years before this game. The object of the game is to run down innocent pedestrians in your souped-up automotive grim reaper. Progress through the race courses in 8 U.S. cities, moving from west to east starting with San Diego and Phoenix. Each race consists of capturing a flag and finding the exit door, all while squishing or gunning down as many people on foot as possible while avoiding helicopters and heat seeking missiles that are actively trying to discourage this unique hobby. If the time runs out, a barrage of missiles descends on the player's car to indicate that the race is over.

The player has a certain amount of money to begin with and earns more money for completing the races alive. This money can be used to upgrade the engine, steering, tires, chassis, or weapon systems on the car.</desc>

	<desc>The Mutech Corporation has created their Gamma Base on what used to be Alcatraz Island. Their attempts at creating computer intelligence has backfired, as the AI they've created has taken over the computer systems and is threatening the world! Deep in the fortress is a gamma bomb, and your goal is to penetrate the fortress to destroy the bomb before it can be used. But be careful, for many Deathbots are guarding the maze-like passageways leading to the bomb! 

Gameplay is from an overhead point of view;  you'll need to find your way through the various passageways to reach the gamma bomb (located on the 8th level) and diffuse it. In addition to doorways and walls, transporters can also be found in the maze. These will instantly teleport you to a new location, and on many levels you will need to figure how to use them correctly to get past otherwise dead ends. Different types of Deathbots guard the passages; and you'll need to use the various weapons you find lying about to get past them, before they destroy you. You have a limited amount of energy. Each time you are hit by enemy fire or by a Deathbot, your energy depletes. Lose all of of your energy and a life is lost. And of course, each level ends with a large boss Deathbot. Good luck on your mission!</desc>

Larger blocks move inward from each side of the screen and attach to the center block, then change color depending on their distance from the center. If the player completes a colored ring, that layer and all the blocks inside of it are cleared, and all the ones outside are moved inward. Play ends if a newly-appearing block overlaps with the player's structure.</desc>

	<desc>This sequel adds new enemy ships to the alien fleet such as firebombers, Yllabian Space Guppies (note that Yllabian is based on "Yllab", the word "Bally" spelled backwards, a friendly poke at Williams' then-competitor, Bally Midway), Dynamos and Space Hums. The Defender ship is now equipped with an Inviso cloaking device, which renders the ship invulnerable when activated, but has a limited charge. A Stargate will transport the ship to any humanoid in trouble. There are now two special stages, the Firebomber Showdown and the Yllabian Dogfight, that occur every fifth and tenth wave. As in the first game, if all the humans are captured the planet explodes and turns all the landers into mutants.</desc>

	<name>Defender of the Crown [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</desc>

	<name>Déjà Vu : Akumu wa Hontou ni Yatte Kita [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Deja Vu was the first game ever made by ICOM, the makers of such famous adventure games as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. 

In Deja Vu your character wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who you are or what you're doing there. To make matters worse, you soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegatable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.

In 1991 a remake of this game was made for Windows 3.x, featuring improved graphics etc.

The gameplay is divided into two parts. You begin in the simulation mode, controlling your ship from first-person perspective. You can change your altitude, speed, and weapons, at the same time paying attention to the fuel you have left. Once you have defeated enough enemies and landed on a planet, the game turns into a side-scrolling shooter in which you must navigate your ship through arcade sequences.</desc>

	<desc>A role-playing game for the NES set within the Romance of the Three Kingdoms mythos that has spawned games on nearly every platform imaginable.  A party is formed by selecting up to five officers from a huge pool, many of whom would only join you after be bribed or defeated in combat.  Officers in turn each had a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Si Ma Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).  One of the first games on the NES to attempt to simulate large scale combat between different forces, although obviously in a very limited way.</desc>

After collecting all the dots, you must collect bibles to seal up the source of the enemies and make the devil temporarily retreat. After this, there is a timed bonus stage where the player can control the scrolling, then the next round starts the cycle over from the beginning.</desc>

	<desc>Devil World is a scrolling maze game, strikingly similar to the classic Pac-Man, only with an undeniable religious bent. Collect dots in an automatically-scrolling maze directed by the devil himself, use crosses to power up and destroy his minions, and be careful not to get crushed by the walls. After collecting all the dots, you must collect bibles to seal up the source of the enemies and make the devil temporarily retreat. After this, there is a timed bonus stage where the player can control the scrolling, then the next round starts the cycle over from the beginning.</desc>

	<name>Dick Tracy [USA]</name>
	<desc>You play as square-jawed detective Dick Tracy as he tries to solve five different crimes that vary in difficulty. This game is mostly a platform game with some overhead driving to get to the different buildings in search of clues.

There are five different weapons in the game: hand gun, tommy gun, super punch, tear gas and Tracy's plain fists. There are also medical kits that can be found. Enemies can be armed or unarmed. If Tracy shoots an unarmed thug, he loses health.

The main goal of the game is to collect five clues; enough to be able to arrest the culprit. Clues are scattered all over town in various buildings, usually full of Tracy-hating thugs. You start by viewing the mug shots of known criminals, going to there last whereabouts and interrogating them.</desc>

	<name>Die Hard [Europe]</name>
	<desc>John McClain decides to visit his wife Holly in Nakatomi Plaza, only to discover that she is taken hostage on 30th floor, along with a bunch of other hostages. The main terrorist, Hans, is after the money locked away in a safe on the 30th floor. His hacker, Theo, is slowly breaking the locks into the vault. It's up to McClain to stop them. Die Hard for the Nintendo Entertainment System is a lot different to its other counterparts. The game is played from a top-down perspective, rather than the 1st-/3rd-person perspective.

There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and the task is to clear each floor of terrorists. The stairwell, air duct or the express elevator is used to travel only to Floors 31-35. These are freely accessible at any time, doing away with linearity, and more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). At the start of the game, John can only use his fists to deal with foes, but after bringing down some terrorists, several weapons become available, including the pistol, machine gun, C-4 explosives, rocket launcher, and flash bangs, using their weapons against them. When hit by these terrorists, John loses some life, but it can be restored by collecting soda cans and med-kits. The game ends when all life is lost. 

One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. Also notable is the "foot meter". It starts out full, but will eventually decrease if John steps on shattered glass or runs around at a faster speed. If the meter is empty, he will walk much slower than with a full meter. This may have been added in tune with the film, where the main character John McClain's feet end up in pretty bad shape near the end. Parts of the environments are destructible, most notably vending machines (receive free soda), glass walls and windows. Not all parts of the environment are shown on the screen all the time - a fog of war appears to shroud nearby areas in darkness.

The missions are time limited. There about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened (shown in the status screen), but more time can be gained by destroying the main computer on the fourth level. Once all the locks have been opened, there are only a few minutes to escape. Once this time expires, the game ends.

Like its counterparts, the game features cinematic sequences, which change the story depending on which actions are taken.</desc>

	<name>Dig Dug [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>

	<desc>It is Dig Dug's job to protect 72 different tropical islands from his arch rivals, Pooka and the fire breathing Fygar. Played from an overhead point of view, Dig Dug now has two weapons at his disposal; the first is an air pump and the second is a drill. The pump can be used to inflate and destroy the enemies the same as in the original Dig Dug. At various locations on the islands are stakes, and when the drill is used near a stake a crack will form. If enough cracks become connected that section of the island will fall into the ocean, hopefully taking an enemy (and not Dig Dug!) with it. When all of the Pookas and Fygars have been destroyed, the game moves on to the next, more difficult level.

The world lies in ruins, and the demons are ripping it apart. You control a group known as Devil Busters. Your mission is to prevent the demonic minions and their evil lord from dominating the entire planet.

In the beginning of the game, you create a party and allocate available skill points at your wish (upgrading strength, stamina, magic, etc.). When you level up, you can also distribute the gained points the way you like. Upon meeting a hostile creature, you can talk your way out of the battle or even convince a demon to fight for you. The game world is viewed partly from top-down perspective, and party from first-person perspective (in dungeons and battles).

	<name>Dirty Harry [USA]</name>
	<desc>Dirty Harry is based on the popular Clint Eastwood movie character of "Dirty" Harry Callahan (rather than the specific movie "Dirty Harry"), a cop famous for his use of a .44 magnum for doing away with evildoers, and for his catchphrase, "Go ahead, make my day." In fact, the game begins with a digitized sample of that quote. The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited. Further, Dirty Harry has a number of other tools at his disposal, provided he collects them.

This is not a one-way side-scroller, however. There are some adventure elements as well, such as being able to walk through alleys to other streets and going through doors to enter building. Entering buildings provides even greater challenges, like snakes and laser flooring. Dirty Harry even takes the fight down to the sewer.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you play a bearded dwarf whose girlfriend has been kidnapped and taken away to the dragon's castle, and in order to rescue her, you must defeat enemies with your mallet. Once you do, you can pick them up and throw them at other enemies, and collect the fruit that they leave behind. When you have defeated all enemies, you proceed onwards to the next round. If you take too long to complete a level, a winged devil will appear who will try to kill you while flying around the screen

Occasionally, power-ups will appear in the middle of the level, and these power-ups will increase your power, award you with different weapons, kill enemies, or freeze time. The more power you have,  the more walls that you can through enemies through. At maximum power, you are able to throw enemies through all walls.
If you happen to carry the blue hammer, you are able to throw it through walls, too.

There are five areas that consist of ten levels each. At the end of each area, you have to defeat a boss in order to proceed further.</desc>

	<desc>A couple is getting married at a wedding chapel, but the wedding is ruined when a bat comes over and turns the groom into a frog. The two dwarfs from Don Doko Don are called in, and are told that they must find a potion that will turn the groom back to his human self.

To do this, you must go through five lands infested by wildlife. Like the original game, you are equipped with a mallet, which can be used to smash enemies. You can then pick these enemies up and toss them at others. When you do this, they leave behind a gem that can be collected for points. During your travels, you can break open chests that contain goodies such as scrolls, extra energy, and more weapons. 

You exit an area by entering through an open doorway, but some doors are locked and must be opened with a key. At the end of each land, you encounter a boss that requires quite a number of hits to kill before you can proceed to the next land.</desc>

	<desc>The Silly Sports are being held in it's traditional home of Italy and Snoopy, from the Peanuts comic strips, will want to attend. Snoopy packs his plane and brings along his relative, Spike as an opponent and the little yellow bird, Woodstock to judge. 

Now Snoopy's ready to compete with 1 or 2 players in his own custom olympiad of the following "events":
The Sack Race: Snoopy and Spike race against one another in competing potato sacks.
Boot Throwing: Just like the Hammer toss, but involving an old boot.
Pogo: Hop on a Pogo Stick and hop over obstacles.
Overboard: Snoopy and Spike play "King of the Boat" trying to knock each other into the water.
Pile of Pizza: Balance the pizzas while trying to walk towards the finish line.
River Jump: Pole Vault over the river (actually sticking the pole into the river) to the other side.

The Japanese version of this game uses a Donald Duck license rather than a Snoopy license (changing many of the character names above), but gameplay remains the same.</desc>

	<desc>The game stars Ronald McDonald (known in Japan as Donald McDonald), the mascot of the McDonald's fast food chain. The objective is to bring peace to his magical land by controlling the famous fast food clown. Most of Ronald's companions have been kidnapped, and the animals have turned feral. His brainwashed companions will occasionally attack. Ronald can defend himself using apple bombs, thrown in a carefully calculated parabola.Being hit by the enemy causes damage, which decreases Ronald's "Life" meter. During various parts of a stage, players have the opportunity to collect up to 100 hamburger icons throughout the game. This will result in gaining a bonus life along with the hamburger counter resetting itself to zero. It is also possible to play a mini-game challenge, to earn commodities that the player orders from McDonald's.

	<name>Donkey Kong [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>

	<desc>Released in the arcades in 1983, Donkey Kong 3 is the third of the "Donkey Kong" arcade game series, changing the format to more of an action-shooter than a platform game. 

As Stanley the Bugman, players are positioned under Donkey Kong, who has taken over a multi-level greenhouse.  Stanley's goal is to remove Donkey Kong from the greenhouse, but the big ape isn't willing to leave without a fight.

Donkey Kong will agitate two beehives that are close to him to send down a swarm of angry Buzzbees, Beespies and destructive Queen Bees toward Stanley.  These insects, as well as caterpillars which creep down nearby vines are intent on destroying the flowers below Stanley.  Donkey Kong will also send down projectiles himself in an attempt to stop Stanley's attacks.  Stanley must jump between the levels and use his bugspray to repel the insects, and send Donkey Kong into the next area of the greenhouse.

Once Stanley pushes Donkey Kong high enough, a can of super bugspray will become available, allowing a larger shooting radius, and is able to send Donkey Kong up the vines faster.

Once Donkey Kong is sent through the three levels of the greenhouse, Donkey Kong will end up with a beehive on his head, and the levels start all over again.</desc>

	<name>Donkey Kong Jr. [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.

Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.

Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.

	<name>Doraemon - Giga Zombie no Gyakushuu [Japan]</name>
	<desc>This game is based on the animé series about the mechanical blue cat Doraemon, who can turn dream into reality and create magical worlds where he helps people and fights the evil. 

Some time ago, Giga Zombie revived dead kings in order to conquer the world. Doraemon and his friends fought the evil being, but were trapped in a magical portal, and ended up in different time periods. In this game, the nameless hero (you can choose to be either male or female) must help Doraemon to find his friends and to save the world once again.

The game is a traditional top-down RPG with turn-based party combat viewed from first person perspective. The unusual part is the time traveling. You and your party can travel to different time periods, change the present and discover many secrets.</desc>

Like the TV show, the game is basically a trivia game with the added enhancement of being able to answer the question, or take a dare. Dares consist of the Toss-up Challenge, the Physical Challenge, and in the last round, the Obstacle Course. Questions are varied, and in large enough number to avoid excessive repetition even over several games worth of play.</desc>

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

A wealthy school principal has placed a challenge for all the school gangs to compete in a special obstacle course composed of 4 different challenges that you and your team must overcome. First in line is a race across the city streets (and rooftops), next is an obstacle course filled with dangerous hazards, then a jumping challenge in which you have to break a series of metal balls, and finally an all-out fighting tournament.

The game uses the same engine and basic gameplay mechanics featured in other Nekketsu High games, with the only change being the goals you must complete to clear each stage. Seeing as how the characters are gang members, fighting and beating your opponents can be a viable way of winning the challenges, so several weapons and power-ups can also be found in the courses</desc>

	<desc>The evil Slick has kidnapped Ryan's girlfriend and taken over the high school. The player is cast as either Ryan or Alex (second player) and has to fight his way through River City's merciless gangs before confronting Slick and freeing his girl. 

River City Ransom is a side-scrolling beat-em-up similar to Double Dragon. The player, or players, travel through the locations of River City, encountering various gangs along the way. Gang members can be defeated with punches and kicks, or beaten up with objects scattered around. Upon their defeat, gang members drop money which Alex and Ryan can spend in malls to buy items that restore health and improve their combat abilities. The main characters have RPG-like numerical stats that can be improved this way, and can also buy books to learn combat manoeuvres. To finish the game, the player(s) have to find and defeat all the bosses.</desc>

	<name>Downtown Special - Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki Dayo Zen [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Downtown Special: Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki da yo - Zenin Shugo! is a Japanese-only sequel to the classic beat 'em up/rpg hybrid Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari aka River City Ransom.

The game takes place in the Edo period of Japan, making it a prequel really, as you take control of an ancestor of Kunio (also named Kunimasa) tasked with saving the life of his ill friend. Kunimasa must traverse the Japanese countryside beating the collection of gang members and other assorted baddies in the same way as in River City Ransom. Each location is represented by a side scrolling level filled with enemies, which you must take down using a collection of attacks and special moves that can be purchased from shops scattered through the levels. 

The game uses the same engine and Super-Deformed character design, only changing the sprites to reflect the new setting. Unlike RCR, you can freely select which stage to tackle at any time, making it a more non-linear experience. And while money is still used to buy items, weapons and moves, you now also gain experience directly by defeating enemies, which is used to enhance Kunio's base stats. 

A two-player mode is available and, even if you play the game solo, the game provides help in the form of an AI-controlled partner who can be change as you gain more allies  thorough the game (including former enemies).

	<name>Dr Chaos [USA]</name>
	<desc>Dr. Chaos was your typical mad scientist. He owned an extensive mansion and spent his time experimenting within it on things that mankind was never meant to know. His latest invention is an Interdimensional Warpgate which allows access to worlds beyond our own. As the doctor's younger brother, Michael, you arrive at Dr.Chaos' mansion one day to find the place crawling with strange mutant creatures. To make matters worse, the mansion itself isn't looking too good. Strange "holes" into other dimensions have opened up and made a mess of the architecture. Furthermore, Dr.Chaos himself is missing.

The game takes place as a platform game where you must use various weapons (knife, pistol, machine pistol or grenade) to fight your way past mutants and into various rooms of the mansion. Once in these rooms, the view changes to a first person maze...  and you'll need to open various cabinets, doors and hit walls in special places to find access into a dimensional hole. Once you enter the dimensional hole, the game once again becomes a platform game, where you will need to fight your way to the end of the level and defeat a boss monster of some sort to obtain a piece of the Warpgate. Then you'll have to proceed BACK through the level and return to the mansion, where you'll explore to find the next dimensional hole.

He becomes a slave to his alter ego and is ultimately destroyed by it. 

In the game, Jekyll must make his way from his home to the church where he is to marry his sweetheart Miss Millicent. He's got to keep his life bar and "Jekyll to Hyde" meter in check, or he'll find himself changed into the nefarious Mr. Hyde.

	<desc>This is an adventure/RPG game based on the popular manga series "Dragon Ball". The story follows one of the series' episodes. Son Goku's friend Krillin is found dead after a fighting tournament. A demon's symbol is engraved on a note left near the body. Master Roshi says that an evil demon named Piccolo Daimaou appeared on the Earth again. It is up to Son Goku to find Piccolo and to revive his friend.

The game introduces the card RPG concept that was later used in Dragon Ball Z RPG series. All your movements in the game depend on your choices of cards that are shown at the bottom of the screen. You move around by choosing cards with appropriate numbers and talking steps on a line of squares. In battles, you choose offensive and defensive cards that will determine the outcome of the fight. You can train with the Master, visit various locations and explore the environments in "Japanese adventure"-fashion.

Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).</desc>

	<name>Dragon Ball Z : Kyoushuu! Saiya Jin [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The game is based on the popular Japanese manga series "Dragon Ball" - more precisely, its Saiyajin Saga part. It follows the events that occur after the evil Radditz tells Son Goku, the series' main hero, about his true origin as a Saiyajin, and suggests uniting their powers. As Son Goku refuses, a battle takes place, and the defeated Radditz threatens to harm Son Goku's son, Son Gohan. Many friends come to help Son Goku, and even his rival Piccolo joins forces with him. But the quest leads them much further - to the ultimate battle against the leader of Saiyajin...

In this fighting/RPG game, you control multiple characters from the series: Son Goku, Piccolo, Krillin, Yamcha, Tienshinhan, Chao-Zu, and Son Gohan. You have to train each character by taking him to battles. All the movements in the game, in battle as well as on the field, occur by collecting and choosing cards of various strength. You move around by selecting a card, and can advance a certain amount of fields depending on its value. You train characters in special training stations before taking them to fights. Once you have trained your character and chose the cards, the battles flow automatically, as cinematic sequences that show Son Goku and his foes exchanging blows while flying.

	<name>Dragon Ball Z II : Gekishin Freeza!! [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The second in the Dragon Ball Z RPG series, "Freezer the Planet Destroyer", as it is often unofficially translated, follows closely the popular manga series and continues the story of the first Dragon Ball Z RPG,  Assault of Saiyajins. After the fight against the Saiyajin leader Vegeta, Son Goku, the series' main hero, is heavily wounded, while his ally Piccolo is dead. Son Goku's son Son Gohan and his friends go to the planet Namek to find the magical Dragon Balls that would bring Piccolo back to life. The trouble is, Vegeta is heading to the planet, and so does the evil Freezer, who is also after the Dragon Balls...

You control both Son Gohan's and Son Goku's parties, including popular characters like Krillin, Yamcha, and others. The gameplay is pretty much the same as in the first game. Locations are composed of squares, and you move through them in a board-game-like fashion, drawing cards that will determine the amount of moves you can make. Random cards will also make you participate in battles, heal your party, add extra cards, etc. In battles you also depend on cards - your choice determines the strength of the move and the outcome of the automatic battle.

	<name>Dragon Ball Z III : Ressen Jinzou Ningen [Japan]</name>
	<desc>"Hot Battle: The Androids" (the game's unofficial English title) is a direct sequel to the  second RPG of the Dragon Ball Z series. Following the events depicted in the manga series those games are based on, "Hot Battle" picks up the story right where it ended in the previous game: in the ultimate battle, Son Goku defeated Freezer, the evil Planet Destroyer. However, Freezer's brother Cooler swears revenge. Son Goku and his friends have once again to fight the evil in order to keep the miraculous Dragon Balls.

In this game, you control many characters from the animé series, including Son Goku, Son Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo, Yamcha, Trunk, and even the archrival Vegeta, who has now joined the team. In battles, you have three active characters, but you can switch and train them in between. The RPG system is similar to the one used in the first two games: your movements on the field and during battles are determined by the type of cards you choose from several available ones. The cinematic battle sequences are now more fast-paced, and there are many mini-games to speed up the leveling up.

	<desc>"Dragon Buster" is a conversion of Namco's arcade game from 1984. The game is composed of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. Your goal in every level is to reach the final stage where you face the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, you move through the platform-like stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since you can't heal your character between the stages.</desc>

Unlike the first game, you are not restricted to a platform here, but can move freely to any direction. You have to go through the maze-like dungeons, find a key, and then get to the exit. After that, the dungeon disappears and makes it possible for you to progress to the next one. You fight enemies with your bow. You have a limited supply of arrows, but you can find quivers among other items in the dungeons.</desc>

	<desc>In Dragon Fighter, the protagonist is a fighter who can turn into a dragon. The game is a side scrolling action game where the hero can walk, jump, and slash with his sword. He can also charge his sword to fire a magical projectile. The real powerup, however, is that he can transform into a flying dragon. When this happens, the game turns into a shmup-style game in which the scrolling moves at a constant rate and the dragon can shoot fireballs in a spread formation. Transforming into a dragon is restricted by a power meter.

Dragon Fighter features 6 levels of action-- a snow level, a cave level, a water level, an industrial level, and a haunted castle level. The sixth and final level is fought entirely as a dragon with unlimited flight capability.</desc>

	<name>Dragon Power [USA]</name>
	<desc>Dragon Power is an action-adventure game developed and published by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System on March 3, 1988. It is a heavily localized version of the Japanese game Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo (translated to Dragon Ball: Mystery of the Dragon God), originally released on November 27, 1986. Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).</desc>

	<desc>Dragon Warrior is the first famous console RPG. You assume the role of a descendant of Erdrick, a brave warrior of the past. Once upon a time, Erdrick defeated the evil Dragonlord with the help of the Ball of Light. Now, Dragonlord stole the Ball of Light, and your mission is to recover it and to restore peace in the world.

In Dragon Warrior, you move your character around in a top-down world. In cities and palaces you can talk to people, rest in inns and buy stuff in shops. There's a variety of weapons, equipment and armor to buy. 

When wandering around in the wilderness, you occasionally encounter enemies, and fight them from 1st person perspective. Combat is turn based: you select menu options while fighting - you can attack with your weapon, cast a spell (using up some of your magic energy), use and item or try to run. Killing monsters gives you experience, and, as is typical for RPGs, you level up and improve your stats when you gain enough experience. 

Like in later RPGs, you have limited hit points, lose them when you are attacked by enemies, and die when you run out of them. When your character dies in a battle, he is automatically restored in a nearby town.</desc>

	<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.</desc>

	<desc>Aeons ago, two dragons and their follower were fighting each other. The  "Black Mages" worshipped the three-headed Chrome Dragon, and the "White Mages" worshipped the glimmering Gold Dragon. The wars fought for territory and ideals where endless. After ages of fighting, the god Narume put the Chrome Dragon to sleep in the mountains and the Gold Dragon to sleep in the desert, to stop the wars. Then he took th magic away from the mages, and sealed it in the 8 Magic Books, which he hid in the sacred desert tower.

Hundreds of years later, three thieves stumbled upon the desert tower, and found the Magic Books. They split them up amongst themselves and every one of them, walked his own way. Now that the Magic Books were gone, the Chrome Dragon awoke from his slumber.  Narume then infused the Gold Dragon with the spirit of justice, summoning him forth in the form of a hero named "Feram"
Now it is up to him, to find the Magic Books and put the Chrome Dragon to sleep again.</desc>

	<name>Dragon Slayer 4 : Drasle Family [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.

Legacy of the Wizard is an side-scrolling action platform game with role-playing elements.  The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.

The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-resoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</desc>

	<desc>Dragon Warrior is the first famous console RPG. You assume the role of a descendant of Erdrick, a brave warrior of the past. Once upon a time, Erdrick defeated the evil Dragonlord with the help of the Ball of Light. Now, Dragonlord stole the Ball of Light, and your mission is to recover it and to restore peace in the world.

In Dragon Warrior, you move your character around in a top-down world. In cities and palaces you can talk to people, rest in inns and buy stuff in shops. There's a variety of weapons, equipment and armor to buy. 

When wandering around in the wilderness, you occasionally encounter enemies, and fight them from 1st person perspective. Combat is turn based: you select menu options while fighting - you can attack with your weapon, cast a spell (using up some of your magic energy), use and item or try to run. Killing monsters gives you experience, and, as is typical for RPGs, you level up and improve your stats when you gain enough experience. 

Like in later RPGs, you have limited hit points, lose them when you are attacked by enemies, and die when you run out of them. When your character dies in a battle, he is automatically restored in a nearby town.</desc>

	<desc>Dragon Warrior II is an early top-down RPG that expands and improves on its predecessor, Dragon Warrior. Taking the role of a descendant of Erdrick, the player once again ventures forth in an effort to save the world.

Unlike the first game, Dragon Warrior II allows the player to join forces with two other characters, a magic-using princess and a wizard-warrior prince. Also including expanded monster battles involving up to 6 creatures and a much larger world, Dragon Warrior II is an important step in the evolution of the Dragon Warrior series.</desc>

	<name>Dragon Warrior III [USA]</name>
	<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.</desc>

	<desc>Dragon Warrior 4, the fourth volume in the Dragon Warrior series (and the last on the NES), once again took the elements of the previous games and expanded them into a five chapter saga of epic proportions.
  The first four chapters are played from the viewpoint of one character per chapter, who will all meet up in the fifth chapter.  From a soldier to a merchant, the game weaves an intriguing story that ties all four characters together in the end.
  Also new in Dragon Warrior 4 is the introduction of battle tactics where the lineup of the characters is important to how much damage they deal.  The player is even given the opportunity to swap a character from reserve into the battle to add a whole new depth of strategy.</desc>

	<desc>Dragon Wars takes place in the magical land of Dilmun, an island of salvation perverted into a world of horror by Namtar (as you might expect - the bad guy).

The player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with nothing more than.. well - nothing. Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). 
Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out).

Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based.

Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities.
Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.</desc>

	<name>Dragon's Lair [Europe]</name>
	<desc>The NES version for Dragon's Lair brings Dirk the Daring in a side-scrolling game, different from the interactive movie gameplay common to the other games under the same license.

Once again, Dirk is up to rescue Princess Daphne from the evil dragon Singe. To do so, Dirk will use weapons such knifes, axes, fire balls, etc, thrown against dragons, bats, snakes, the Lizard King (who will steal gold from him), among other foes. He will also do a lot of jumping and ducking to avoid threats along his way, such as falling bridges, presses, spikes and holes on the floor. To complete a stage, all he has to do is to get to the end of it alive.

At the end of some stages, Dirk will take an elevator that will lead him to other stages. The elevator makes short stops at some platforms, and you have to decide if Dirk will jump onto that platform or another. If  he takes the wrong platform, he may go back to a previous stage and go through it all over again. From the elevator Dirk can also get to a bonus level, the Lizard King's throne room, where he can try to recover the gold the King has stolen from him.

Although Dirk has a life bar, he will instantly die if takes damage from the most of the threats. He also has a "candle bar", which is used (by pressing the start button) to light up dark places and to discover hidden items at specific locations.

The game can be played by 2 players taking turns. The PAL version has faster gameplay, additional enemies (including level bosses), death animations and splash screens in between the levels.</desc>

	<name>Drop Zone [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Dropzone was the first game to propel Archer Maclean to stardom. The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. 

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</desc>

	<name>Duck Hunt</name>
	<desc>Duck Hunt is a shooting simulation where the player goes out with his faithful dogs to hunt ducks. It requires the use of the Zapper light gun. In game modes A and B, players view a swampland from a first-person perspective. The dog scares ducks (one or two at a time) out of the swamp, and they go flying around in the air. The player has three shots and a limited amount of time to shoot the ducks before they fly away. Each round only allows a limited number of misses in order to move on successfully. As the rounds progress, the ducks begin flying faster and faster, and fewer misses are allowed.

Mode C features target practice on clay pigeons rather than ducks. The perspective and rules here are the same, with only three shots to destroy two clay pigeons before they disappear off the horizon. Destroy enough clay pigeons to move on to the next, tougher round.</desc>

	<desc>Duck Tales for NES is a traditional platform game in which the player takes the role of greedy Scrooge McDuck in search of treasures around the globe. He counts on his three nephews and on other Duck Tales characters to help him in his quest through inospit places such as the Amazononic forest, the African Mines, the Himalayas, Transylvania (where he meets Dracula Duck) and even the Moon.

Each one of them reserves the old duck lots of adventure, different enemies and hidden rooms.

The game features a 2D side-scrolling platform gameplay very similar to Mega Man. Graphics are colorful and cartoonish, music remembers players of the TV series and controls are very simple.

The one caveat is that your dude has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, you have to bounce across a paint can (an attitude converter) that will change your dude to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time. This is an unlicensed game.</desc>

"Dungeon Magic" is a first-person RPG that looks similar to  Wizardry games, but instead of the usual turn-based combat you fight your enemies in real time, parrying to avoid their blows and attacking physically or casting offensive magic to hurt them.

	<desc>All weekend ballplayers know softball's no joke, but that doesn't mean you can't have a little fun with it. And when you step up to the plate in this cart you'll find the wackiest bunch of players to ever hit a softball diamond!

Play seven inning fast or slow-pitch games. In One Player mode, you face the computer in a five-game elimination tournament. Win them all, and you earn the right to challenge the awesome Amazons - All-Star Softball's all-time championship team. Of course, you and a friend can play each other in a head-to-head contest.

There are no preset ball clubs so you recruit 10-member squad from a roster of 60 weird players. Look for players who have strong basic baseball skills such as arm strength and speed. But to win on some of the tricky fields you'll also need players with more unusual skills - such as climbing fences, diving into water, and flying at night

In fast pitch, you hurl that baby in three speeds. But stay alert, base runners steal and batters bunt. In slow pitch, you can lob the ball short or long. You can also make your pitches curve right or left.Fielding the ball takes practice, but your guys can also dive for hard grounders and leap up to snare line shots. For quick double plays, infielders can tag a base then throw the ball.

With six softball fields to choose from, including the Sandlot, the Cliff, and a Professional field, there's some great action. Get ready to take yourself out to the softball park.</desc>

	<desc>Our hero the white Bomberman (Bomberman Shiro) was walking down the street one day when he witnessed a robbery. It was black Bomberman (Bomberman Kuro) who was the robber. But Black Bomberman knocked White Bomberman to the ground, and than left the money so that he would be framed. Now Bomberman has been taken to jail and must fight his way out of this place using the only method he knows: explosive bombs.

Bomberman is the second Bomberman game in the series and plays similar to the first, only all gameplay has been reduced to a single screen. Your goal however remains the same on a smaller playing area. You are to destroy all enemies on a level and then find the exit to the next one. Bombing the exit is always a bad idea. The occasional power-up will increase your bomb blast, number of bombs on the screen at one time, player speed or give you the ability to walk through walls.

In addition to the single Player game, Bomberman II introduces a Versus Mode for 2 players and a Battle Mode for 3. Your goal in these is to destroy the other players while staying alive yourself.

	<name>Dynamite Batman [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The Joker lives again in SunSoft's sequel to their NES 
original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must fight him across seven stages to restore peace to Gotham City.

Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses. 

Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.

Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers. Two levels require you to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep pace in the background. Some levels also have Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short side-scrolling shooter. 

This game is one of the few Batman games that was not based directly on a movie or television series.

	<name>Dynowarz : The Destruction Of Spondylus [USA]</name>
	<desc>This is a game of combat between giant mechanized dinosaurs named robosaurs in a faraway solar system named Spondylus. Mad robosaurs have overrun the planets of this man-made solar system and it is up to Professor Proteus to take the controls of the #1 robosaur, the Cyborasaurus. The goal is to get to the center of all 7 planets in this solar system and disable the artificially intelligent life support systems, which are guarded by progressively tougher defense.

Gameplay consists of getting into your robosaur, tromping across the surface of desolate planets in the solar system, fighting meaner robosaurs, and equipping better weapons along the way (you can launch your dino's fist!). Once you make it to the middle of each planet, you eject from the Cyborasaurus and head to the life support computer. Destroy the computer and get out fast.

	<name>Mother [USA] (Proto)</name>
	<desc>In the early 1990s, a mysterious dark shadow covered a small country town in rural America. A young married couple vanished from their house without a trace. The man's name was George, the woman's name was Maria. Two years passed, and George suddenly returned. He never spoke to anyone about what he had experienced. Instead, he lead a solitary life and began an odd study, all by himself. His wife never returned.

Eighty years have passed since then. You play the role of a young boy who lives in a small town together with his parents and his two sisters. One day, something strange happens: the house seems to be possessed by a poltergeist. Things start attacking house inhabitants. The boy's father advises him to talk to his grandfather and to learn how to use psychic powers in order to discover the reason behind the strange poltergeist. On his journey, the boy meets three other children: a quiet girl who lives together with her mother, a young genius who isn't accepted by his classmates, and a boy who joined a gang, hoping for revenge. The four heroes will explore the world and find out the connection between the strange events of today and the mystery of the past.

Closely related to the SNES game  EarthBound, "Mother" is an unusual console-style RPG set in modern times. Combat system is similar to Dragon Warrior: you meet random enemies and bosses, and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Instead of magic, your characters can use special psychic powers called PSI.</desc>

	<name>Egger Land - Meikyuu no Fukkatsu [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Eggerland: Meikyuu no Fukkatsu, which translates to Revival of the Labyrinth, is a game in the Eggerland series consisting of several puzzles games. You play as Lolo, a blue ball-like character with eyes, arms, and legs. The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only she is red.

Again it's up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him. You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). All the rooms are connected but not all the room entrances or exits are closed.

To fight the monsters Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers.

There are numerous types of obstacles in the rooms. Emerald Framers are green blocks that Lolo may push around freely. To make it all more challenging there are also numerous terrain obstacles, like water, sand and grass which have all different drawbacks for Lolo.</desc>

	<path>/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/nes/Elevator Action (Japan) (Rev A).zip</path>
	<name>Elevator Action [Japan]</name>
	<desc>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.

Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:

1. Shooting them with his gun.
2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.
3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.
4. Crushing them with an elevator.

Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.

While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. 

Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.

Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.

If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</desc>

	<name>Eliminator Boat Duel [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Eliminator Boat Duel is a ruthless one on one boat racing game that can either be played against the computer or a human opponent. The races take place in such settings as open water, the bayou, and even industrial water districts. Each boat race consists of several sections. First, there is the starting line -- where you can expect a $2000 fine for a false start -- which begins with a brief side-scrolling race with split-screen background scrolling, a common characteristic of later NES titles. The primary sections of the races are a mixture of top-down racing and 3rd-person racing from a perspective behind the boats. The top-down sections are the most involved with numerous threats to avoid such as alligators, sharks, and whirlpools that will turn you the wrong way. There are also ramps to jump off of, people in need of rescue, nitro speed boost powerups, and raw cash bonuses to collect. The 3rd person segments have less detail and distraction but move much quicker as the 2 players vie to stay within the flags, collect speed boosts, and hit the occasional ramp. Speed boosts are collected along the way and can be used at the player's discretion to gain a much-needed edge at any point during the race.

A race finishes back in the side-scrolling view. If the boats come through too close together, the bikini models on the sidelines act confused and request a slo-mo replay, which the game subsequently provides. Prize money is then awarded with which the players may use to repair and upgrade their boats with faster engines, tougher hulls, and better steering.</desc>

	<name>Elite</name>
	<desc>You have a ship with virtually no equipment. Take her and trade among the different star systems. You can be safe and trade on razor-thin margins among the safe systems, or take some risks and trade with anarchic systems while watching out for pirates. You can save on fuel costs by buying a fuel scoop and fly near the sun, but again, watch out for pirates! Or be a pirate yourself and raid other ships...  Don't get a bad rep as the police will come after you... Dock with space stations and do your trades (some may take contraband...) Upgrade your ship with your proceeds with better weapons,  shields, and other equipment. With 8 different galaxies, each with HUNDREDS of planets, there are plenty of room for exploration! Can you make your reputation all the way up to "elite"?</desc>

	<name>Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Two children, the girl Erika and the boy Satoru, live together in a small house somewhere in modern Japan. One day, before going to sleep, they notice a strange creature outside: it looks like a pink-white cat (Final Fantasy fans would immediately say: a moogle!), but talks like a human being. Before the mysterious creature disappears, it says only a short sentence: "Children! Find the Time Crown!". Without understanding what he meant by this, but realizing it must be something important, the two young heroes embark the next day on a dangerous journey - the quest for the power of the crown!

"Erika &amp; Satoru" plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, although you can also move on the overworld, visiting locations by standing on them and pressing the A button. Upon visiting a location, you can interact with characters and objects you view from first-person perspective by selecting icons located in the corner of the screen: talk to characters, examine, manipulate items, etc. The unusual part is that you control two characters: you can (and should) switch between them and sometimes work together in order to fulfil your quest. There is also a two-players mode, where Erika and Satoru cooperate while being controlled each one by a different player.</desc>

	<desc>It is an exploration game which uses Jaleco's arcade game Psychic 5 as the basis for the story and the cast of characters which you use throughout the game. Each character possesses different attributes, including their jumping ability, their ability to hover in mid-air, and their strength. As in the arcade, some characters must be rescued in order to make them playable. This game boasts over 50 household items which serve as animated enemies throughout each level. The game was never sold outside of Japan, or translated from Japanese to any other language.
Akio, being a member of the Esper Corps organization which supposedly fights Evil all over the world. His task is quite simple - save his friends and somebody else from the Devil's Castle with his formidable hammer and... enormously jumpy feet... (you'll see what I mean when you play it). The game is quite lengthy and mazy at places, so do talk to strange dwellers of that place (don't be afraid to use the START button to talk).</desc>

	<name>F1 Circus [Japan]</name>
	<desc>F1 Circus is a Formula 1 simulation racing game. Unlike later entries in the series, this version does not feature an official license, and so only features generic teams and drivers. Races are viewed from a top-down perspective, and there are a variety of machine settings as well as basic vehicle damage.

A total of 15 courses are on offer, and there is a World Championship mode, as well as a "Constructors" mode for one or two players where the player can take the role of team manager while the computer does the actual racing. The Famicom release also adds a Time Attack mode for practicing and perfecting each course.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, which is similar to Pole Position, the player takes control of an F1 car. The player can race the vehicle on one of three different skill levels. Each skill level contains five different tracks for the player to race on. On each of these tracks, the player must complete 2 laps before a countdown timer expires. The player must also try not to crash into other racers and obstacles on the sides of the road. The vehicle has a manual transmission, so the player has to switch between low and hi gear while racing.

	<desc>Famicom Jump II: Saiky no Shichinin (Famikon Janpu Ts Saiky no Shichinin, lit. "Famicom Jump II: The Strongest Seven") is a 1991 RPG for the Family Computer published by Bandai. The sequel to Famicom Jump: Hero Retsuden, the game features seven main characters (as the subtitle indicates) from different Weekly Sh?nen Jump manga serialized at the time. Only four of the 16 represented titles from the original are brought back, while the remaining three are new to the sequel. There would not be another crossover game until the release of Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars (of which six of these series would be represented, the only one not being Magical Tarurto-kun).
The player may begin the game with any of these seven characters. The player character chosen reflects the path the player will take through the characters' universes- starting from the selected character's home universe.

	<desc>The Red Star nation and the Blue Moon nation are at war. Each has deployed troops and works to obtain enough funds so as to buy the necessary military hardware to overcome the other side.

Famicom Wars is a turn-based strategy game. The player takes the role of commander of military forces for either the Red Star or Blue Moon armies. The goal of each battle map is to overcome the other side's forces, destroying all enemy units and capturing all enemy-held landmarks. Each side of the battle takes their turn, moving units across the map. The capture of cities will give that side extra funds which can be used to build new units at factories and shipyards.

Famicom Wars features 17 maps total to battle across.</desc>

	<name>Family Block [Japan]</name>
	<desc>A "Breakout" type game with interesting characters such as Mr. Chin and the Thunder Warrior.  Mr. Chin holds a stick over his head that acts as the paddle.  If your ball hits one of the power-up carriers (Flying Saucer, Submarine or Airplane) you have to try and pick up the released power-up while continuing to keep the ball in play.

Power-ups are:

1. Glove: Catch the ball and then release with the A button.
Long: Mr. Chin's stick will become longer.
1-Up: Get an extra life for Mr. Chin.
Missile: Gain fire power, press the A button to launch a missile, catch a second missile to fire two missiles simultaneously.
Big Ball: The ball enlarges and blows through any type of block in its path.
Slow: This will slow the speed of the ball.
3 Balls: The ball will split into three balls and as long as you keep one ball from falling you will always have three balls.
6 Balls: The ball will split into six balls.

"Bad Characters" will occasionally appear and try to mess with Mr. Chin.

1. Sea Anemone: If he captures your ball it will split into two smaller balls.
Octopus: He lives underwater inside an ancient vase, if the vase is hit by the ball the octopus will come out and try and latch onto Mr. Chin's stick.  If he succeeds he will weigh you down causing you to move slower.
Turtle: They will walk over the wall and transform themselves into new blocks to hinder your progress.
Bird: If hit with your ball it will fly out of control smashing through the walls before flying away.
Thunder Warrior: If you hit the Thunder Warrior with your ball he will release a circle of lightning bolts that will fly around him. The lightning bolts will destroy the walls but they will momentarily paralyze Mr. Chin if he is hit.</desc>

	<name>Family Circuit [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Family Circuit is a racing game for Nintendo's Family Computer (known to some as the NES), hence the name. Unlike other Nintendo racing games at the time, it has many realistic traits, removing itself from the main crop of more arcade oriented titles. The car can be customized to your heart's content, with different tires, wings and suspension and detailed engine settings for both turbo and torque.

Four racing modes are available:

1. Free run: Run any way you want around the track, getting to know both the curves and straights as well as the settings of your car.
2. Sprint race: Race a season in four classes  novice, B class, A class and Super A  around well-known (Fuji, Suzuka) and less well-known tracks (Family Park, Namcot-ring), competing for the first place.
3. Endurance race: Run around and around a track to see who gives up last.
4. Spectator mode: Not a real racing mode, but allows you to follow any car in any class around any track.

As you bump into things or push the car too far, you must pit in, where you will be given statistics for each part of the car and may choose to fix it. Some of this realism is however forfeited by the fact that cars can never collide. Racing straight through an opponent with both cars undamaged is perfectly possible.</desc>

The four mini-games are based on: A typical game show set up, where answering questions correctly raises that player's podium towards a balloon; Othello, where the goal is to surround the other player's pieces; a board-game, where the player moves their piece around the board; a card-based memory game, where the goal is to flip over pairs of matching cards. In each game, the player gets a turn only after they've answered the trivia question correctly.</desc>

	<name>Dance Aerobics [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Dance Aerobics is a chance to get fit by following the movements of an aerobics instructor.

Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4 by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.

The second mode is mini-games called Pad Antics that includes Tune Up, Mat Melodies, and Ditto. Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80 points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song.  Ditto is like a one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every successful position.

The third mode is Aerobics Studios.  Aerobics Studios is the same as the main game but with only 4 levels (Studio 5,  Studio 10, Studio 15, and Studio 20) all unlocked at the start, a score that counts down from 100 with mistakes (or up if the player is doing well), no progression in levels, and the player can continue playing even if there score is at 0.</desc>

	<desc>Super Team Games is a side scrolling game where two players compete in races on an obstacle course. The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</desc>

	<desc>Fantasy Zone II: The Tears of Opa-Opa is the sequel to Fantasy Zone, in which you control Opa-Opa, a pretty colored ship with wings on its side. You must destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row.

More often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the original can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend money in the shop to get new weapons (but they only last for a limited time).</desc>

Fast-forward to three months later. You are a nameless young adventurer, looking for some action. Your first task is... you guessed it, to rescue a princess.

"Faria" is a combination of console-style RPG exploration and character development (like in  Final Fantasy or  Dragon Quest) with real-time battles. On the world map, you are randomly attacked by enemies, and have to eliminate them running around the battle field and attacking them physically or casting spells. In the complex, maze-like towers the enemies appear everywhere. There is also a good deal of puzzles to solve in the dungeons.</desc>

	<desc>This 2D platformer has elements of role-playing and adventure in addition to side-scrolling action.

The story is a classic one of good versus evil.  Disaster strikes the once peaceful Elf town of Eolis. The sky rains meteorites upon the World Tree - wild animals and evil monsters terrorize the citizens - the water supply from the wells is dwindling - plants are withering - people are dying. Only you can restore peace to the land by conquering the Evil One, who lives in the Evil Place.

There are many places you must visit during your quest including the medieval town, where you begin, country villages, fortresses, caves, and gloomy bogs - each with its own ambiance and musical score.  You will be talking with the villagers, collecting gold to buy weapons, armor and other objects, jumping over obstacles and using items.  Attack zombies, dwarves, giant snakes, wyverns, evil gnomes, or one-eyed one-footed things with a large collection of swords and daggers or zap them with a magic spell. 

As areas are completed by defeating enemies, your character rises up in levels and achieves a new rank which is tied directly to the restore password (called a mantra in the game). The higher your rank, the more gold you start out with.  Saving a game can only be done in a shrine or temple with a priest.  This is also where you are transported when you restart the game - or if you die.</desc>

	<name>Faxanadu [USA]</name>
	<desc>This 2D platformer has elements of role-playing and adventure in addition to side-scrolling action.

The story is a classic one of good versus evil.  Disaster strikes the once peaceful Elf town of Eolis. The sky rains meteorites upon the World Tree - wild animals and evil monsters terrorize the citizens - the water supply from the wells is dwindling - plants are withering - people are dying. Only you can restore peace to the land by conquering the Evil One, who lives in the Evil Place.

There are many places you must visit during your quest including the medieval town, where you begin, country villages, fortresses, caves, and gloomy bogs - each with its own ambiance and musical score.  You will be talking with the villagers, collecting gold to buy weapons, armor and other objects, jumping over obstacles and using items.  Attack zombies, dwarves, giant snakes, wyverns, evil gnomes, or one-eyed one-footed things with a large collection of swords and daggers or zap them with a magic spell. 

As areas are completed by defeating enemies, your character rises up in levels and achieves a new rank which is tied directly to the restore password (called a mantra in the game). The higher your rank, the more gold you start out with.  Saving a game can only be done in a shrine or temple with a priest.  This is also where you are transported when you restart the game - or if you die.</desc>

	<desc>Prehistoric platform game where you are in control of a baby and have to guide him through the levels avoiding all manner of strange nasties.

The game is very similar to every other platform game you have ever played, but it does have its own unique features such as the ability to climb vertical walls with your teeth and do a diving head butt from a jump. Power ups come in the form of lumps of meat and give extra speed and invulnerability in the later stages.

If you have ever played chuck rock then you know what to expect from this, a bog standard platform game with a prehistoric theme.</desc>

	<name>Felix the Cat [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous cartoon character.

The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. 

There are four different types of levels. 

1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.

Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

Levels that take place entirely under water.

Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.

Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.

The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</desc>

	<name>Fengshenbang</name>
	<desc>During the final days of Shang-Yin dynasty in China (11th century BC), general Li Jing had a son named Ne Zha. The boy had extraordinary talents for martial arts, and for that reason the god Tai Yi gave him three powerful artifacts. One day he went to swim in the sea and disturbed the prince of dragons. The prince became angry and went out of the water to fight Ne Zha. Unaware of the power of the artifacts, Ne Zha unintentionally killed the prince. The Dragon Lord could not China if Ne Zha stays alive. Ne Zha killed himself to protect his land, and Tai Yi, touched by his sacrifice, revived him and made him more powerful than ever before. Now Ne Zha is strong enough to find three other legendary warriors and to defeat the evil king Zhou, the last one of Shang-Yin dynasty, and to put a just ruler on the throne instead.

Fengshenbang is a traditional Asian-style RPG. Most of the game is spent fighting random enemies and gain experience points to level up. The turn-based combat is viewed mostly from first-person perspective, although you can see your characters on the screen when they are attacking. The simple battle system allows you to use physical attacks or cast magic. The interface of the game requires you to select actions from a menu, in  Dragon Quest style.</desc>

	<desc>Fighting Hero is an unlicensed fighting game created by NTDEC in 1991, based off Street Fighter. The controls are similar to the original Street Fighter in that A punches and B kicks. However, the controls are often criticized because attacks initiate once the player lets go of the button. You're also unable to walk while holding a button. If you let go of the button too quick, Leon will only move for about a frame and the attack won't come out. Jump attacks preform a bit differently: you must hold the button and then jump. Leon will preform the attack a certain point in the air. For whatever reason, you're unable to preform special moves unless you have a cheat code.</desc>

	<desc>The game is a fairly typical one-on-one fighting game. It appears to use a similar engine to Rex Soft's fighting games, with slow walking, quick jumping, and generally choppy animation. The A button punches and the B button kicks, with both having different animations if the player holds Back or Forward while attacking. It is possible to throw by pressing Back and A while close, and blocking is performed by holding Back.
The cast consists of 10 original characters. Each character has two duplicates with different names and colors. In single-player, the player always uses the original, and the computer always uses the first duplicate.
Much like the first Fighting Hero, the game has a high difficulty level that cannot be changed, although the player is given nine continues.</desc>

The game plays from a non-scrolling side view and plays like most one-on-one fighters: you move around the screen avoiding your opponent's attacks and then unleash your own with combinations of your attack buttons and directional arrows. Additionally the game features special moves in the form of specific combinations of directional moves that trigger unique attacks. These moves however deplete your stamina bar which can leave you defenseless against enemy attacks.</desc>

	<name>Final Fantasy [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of one of the longest role-playing game series known to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.

The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real journey begins...

Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. 

In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. 

Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic.

	<desc>Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of one of the longest role-playing game series known to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.

The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real journey begins...

Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. 

In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. 

Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up magic points, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.</desc>

Final Fantasy II (not to be mistaken with Final Fantasy IV, released in USA as "Final Fantasy II"), like its predecessor, is a top-down role-playing game where you travel through the overworld, fighting baddies and buying things and resting in cities. It features round-based combat (you input menu commands for the whole party, and then watch the combat round unfold). It has an unusual character-building system: there are no classes and also no levels, but characters grow stronger by performing the same action over and over. Get hit a lot and your HP will increase; cast more spells and your intelligence will raise (but your physical power might decrease), and so on. Weapons and spells, on the other side, can be leveled up. The more you use a certain type of level, the more proficient the character who uses this weapon becomes; the more you cast a certain magic spell, the more damage it does.</desc>

	<desc>Final Lap by Namco is considered by many to be the spiritual successor to Pole Position. This fairly straightforward Formula 1 racing game features a one or two player mode which is raced via split-screen. Up to eight players can take turns playing in a tournament mode. 

The initial race takes place on an oval track in New York while subsequent tracks with more challenging turns and corners will take players all over the world; from Mexico to Monaco. Each car can be upgraded before a race with allotted points to customize the tires, engine, brakes, and nitro. Nitro is kicked in by pressing up on the control pad. Colliding into competitors will bump your car back but sliding into billboards on the side can cause your vehicle to spin out.</desc>

	<desc>Dark Forces have attacked the land of Aritia. You're controlling some of the members of the Aritan's forces that escaped from their country and came on the island of Tamis for safety. Unfortunately, a group of pirates is invading the Tamis, and it's up to you to control the island again.

Fire Emblem is a strategy game where you have to move your units on a map. You can control the blue units while the red ones are enemies. You have to attack enemies from various ranges, in function of the weapon you're using. Usually, you have to be one or two squares next to the enemy. When a battle is set, you see both characters; allies in blue on the right and the opponent in red on the left with a detailed animation. The enemy will counterattack if he can, and either you or the enemy may also do one more hit to close the battle. When you've finished, it's the computer's turn and it will do the same with its units. Once the HP (Health Points) of any unit reaches 0, they are definitely out of battle and can't return again, whether it's an enemy or an ally.

	<desc>In Fisher-Price: Firehouse Rescue, the player controls a fireman driving a firetruck. Both the fireman and the firetruck bear the familiar style of the popular Fisher-Price toy line. The object of the game is to rescue pets from trees and people from houses in the immediate neighborhood. There are 2 parts to this task: the first part involves navigating the maze-like streets from an overhead perspective in order to find the troubled residence. Once the house is reached, the second part of the job is to maneuver the firetruck's ladder underneath the person or animal in need of rescue, from a side perspective, and letting them down to safety.

While the first level confines the entire neighborhood to a one-screen maze, later levels span multiple screens, thereby increasing the challenge. Further, later levels also add time limits and additional keys that the player must collect before attempting the rescue mission.

	<desc>Fisher-Price: I Can Remember is a card-based game of memory transposed onto the NES. The object is to flip over pairs of cards and find pairs that match. If an unmatched pair is flipped then they get flipped back and the player must remember that data for their next turn. The game has 3 levels, with each having progressively more cards (12, 16, or 20). The cards contain pictures of Fisher-Price toys. Finding matches removes the cards from the screen which then reveals parts of a larger Fisher-Price item.

The game allows a player to play alone, or it allows 2-player competitive play. Further, it also allows human vs. computer competition, where the computer player is named "Electro".</desc>

According to the story mentioned in the manual, Kenshirou, the main character, has to save the people from the evil Emperor Heaven. The game itself, however, features no story whatsoever, but a lot of platform action instead. You have to run quickly through the levels (there is a time limit), punching and kicking your enemies, causing them to fly away or to explode, occasionally meeting a boss, visiting secret areas behind doors and collecting various power-ups. 

This is in fact the second game in the series; the first one was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

Red Stones are placed in key locations across the levels.  They can be pushed, stacked on top of each other, and even destroyed.  Flappy must strategically take advantage of the gravity and the Red Stones in order to clear the path for pushing the Blue Stone.  Three different types of enemies will try to prevent Flappy from clearing the level, so you must either avoid the enemies, crush them from above with the Stones, or pick up Sleeping Mushrooms to knock them out temporarily.</desc>

	<name>The Flintstones : The Rescue of Dino &amp; Hoppy [Europe]</name>
	<desc>The Flintstones and the Rubbles were enjoying a fine day when suddenly, someone from the future called Dr. Butler arrived and stole their pets, Dino and Hoppy!  Butler plans to feature the pets in his intergalactic zoo, and what's worse, he's destroyed the Great Gazoo's time machine so that no-one could stop him!  It's up to everyone's favourite caveman, Fred Flintstone, to find the pieces to the time machine and repair it, so that they can travel to the future and confront Dr. Butler once and for all!

The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino &amp; Hoppy is a side-scrolling platformer for the NES.  In it, you control Fred Flintstone through various locations such as Bedrock, Reef Rock, the Jungle and more as he searches for the missing pieces of Gazoo's time machine.  Fred has his trusty club which he can use to attack with, or charge up it's power by holding B for a more deadly attack.  Fred can collect coins after defeating enemies, which are used to pay for secondary weapons like slingshots and tomahawks, as well as special abilities such as flying and diving.

After completing the first level, the player is presented with an overworld map that allows you to choose which level you'd like to go to.  There are also basketball courts on the map - if you beat your opponent in a game of basketball, you can earn one of the special abilities which are required for use later.

	<desc>Fred and Barney are searching for their children, Pebbles and Bam-Bam who got lost. When they finally find them, a volcanic eruption blocks their way and so they start going all the way around the mountain to find out why this happened and of course to save their children. 

The Surprise at Dinosaur Peak is the second Flintstones-licensed game for the NES. There are two characters you can play with. By pressing the Select button you can change from Fred to Barney and vice versa. Each character has unique abilities that are needed to complete certain parts of each stage. For example Fred can grab the edges of a roof or a hill and climb while Barney can hang from ropes and vines. In terms of weapons Fred has a bat which is stronger and can also be charged for extra power but it takes more time to use. Barney on the other hand has a slingshot and can shoot small rocks for ranged attacks but rather weak. There are also weapons like throwing axes and bowling balls that both can use.

	<name>Flying Dragon : The Secret Scroll [USA]</name>
	<desc>The grand master Juan was robbed of the secret scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, which is the ultimate kung-fu stance that gives the impression of a flying dragon when in effect. Luckily Juan has entrusted the remaining scroll to his worthy student, Ryohi. Juan's last request was for Ryohi to visit Shorinji. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji, took the young Ryohi under his wing.  Six years later, a letter of challenge is sent from the Tusk Soldiers, who are the enemies of Shorinji, The letter mentions the upcoming "World Tournament of Contact Sports". Ryuhi decides to take part in the tournament as a representative of Shorinji. Ryuhi also hears from  Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who robbed Ryuhi's master of his scrolls and now Ryuhi plans on getting them back.

The player controls Ryuhi. During the side-scrolling portion of the game the player can use kung fu to dispose of enemies. There are also miniboss type enemies (the screen turns black when they appear)  that must be defeated because they drop items that must be collected in order to continue on. The items they drop go in a sequence of power-ups which will eventually allow you to get a key to exit the level. There are some one on one duels during fighting tournaments that involve hitting a target on an opponents body while defending the target on Ryuhi's body.

	<name>Freedom Force [USA]</name>
	<desc>In Freedom Force, Rad Rex and his partner Manic Jackson are part of an elite counter terrorism unit. Their mission is to save the hostages in a hijacked plane by killing all the Bagmen. After they successfully take back control of the plane they must work there way back though the airport and streets to take out the guerrillas hideout to get to their leader, Eugene Extreme.

Freedom Force is a light gun game that is played with the Nintendo Zapper. The object of the game is to kill all of the bad guys with out losing all of Rads health or killing too many hostages or civilians. The friends and foes appears though doors and windows, and from behind objects forcing a quick decision whether to shoot them or not. There are 5 levels in total (Aeroplane, Gangway, Airport Terminal, Street, and Hideout) and the 4 different types of weapons that enemies have are guns (one shot), machine guns (one burst loses about quarter health), grenades (instant kill but can be shot in air), and missiles (faster then grenades).

To help the player an icon can appear quickly in the lower left corner of the screen representing health, ammo, gun, a grenade launcher (weapon to kill everyone at once, not good with hostages and civilians around), and a harder difficulty (more enemies), that the player must shoot to activate. A two-player mode is available with the two players taking turns, with the second player playing Manic Jackson. There is also a hangman mini-game that is played between every two levels where the player must shoot the correct letter when it is lit up.</desc>

	<name>Friday the 13th [USA]</name>
	<desc>Based on the popular movie franchise, Friday the 13th casts you as one of six camp counselors (three girls or three boys) at the infamous Camp Crystal Lake, and you are tasked with destroying Jason Voorhees once and for all.

To get to Jason, you must run around a camp, killing zombie ghouls and collecting weapons, until you hear an alarm sound.  When that alarm goes off, it means Jason has entered a cabin and you must find him.

To save time, you can switch between all six counselors, depending on where you are.  Once you enter the house that Jason is in, the game switches to a 3D-esque maze in which you have to hurt Jason with the items you collected.  Once he's been damaged enough, he'll run away, only to sound another alarm later and enter another house.</desc>

Jungles, deserts, brush, and rocks all slow your progress, plus each area has numerous enemy fighters and tanks trying to stop you. To help get past these obstacles, you are armed with a machine gun and grenades; at some points in the game you may even come across an abandoned tank which you can control to increase your odds of survival. When you reach the end of the level and successfully destroy the fortress, the game will repeat at a higher level of difficulty.

	<name>Fun House [USA]</name>
	<desc>Fun House is based on a children's television game show of the same name.

The basic premise of the game is to get through the 72 rooms of the Fun House. The object of each room is to throw tomatoes at the targets littered throughout the room before time expires. Sometimes these targets are numbered, so they have to be hit in numerical order. After all targets are hit, a key will appear allowing the player to move on to the next room. 

This may appear simple, but the player's character is on rollerblades, thus making navigating not such a simple task. There are also blobs, boingers, the banana launcher, and the spray gun which will either try to hinder progress or take away time if the player gets hit by them. The player also has to deal with various terrain obstacles in each room such as slime covered ramps or icy floors.

The player starts with three lives, but can earn more by collecting 25 silver coins. There are also gold coins with each one equaling 5 silver coins.

Other helpful items the player can collect are glop clocks, with the small ones adding 8 seconds, and the large ones adding 15 seconds to the game clock. There are also sneakers which will temporarily increase the player's speed. There are also starbursts, which increase the players score and warp cubes, which will send the player to another part of the Fun House.</desc>

	<name>Futebol [Brazil] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>This game is a modified version of Ultimate League Soccer; instead of national teams, the game features teams from the Brazilian football league (with different characteristics than the original teams).

One of two players can play a single match between any of the 8 teams available, or one player can play either one of the two championships available.

The &amp;quot;World Cup&amp;quot; championship let the player choose one of 8 Brazilian teams: Internacional, Flamengo, São Paulo, Vasco, Corinthians, Palmeiras, Fluminense or Santos. The &amp;quot;Olympic&amp;quot; championship available restricts the choice to the 4 first teams: Internacional, Flamengo, São Paulo and Vasco. Each team has its own characteristics, varying in offensive, defense, speed, skill, accuracy and experience traits.

After selecting the team, players are prompted to choose the color of their team's uniform, among white, green, gray and red. They are also prompted to choose the duration of the periods (15, 30 or 45 minutes - which run faster than real time). They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.

The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective. While conducting the ball layers can make short passes (with button B) or strong kicks (with button A, stronger the longer the button is held). Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.

Players can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.</desc>

	<name>G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero [USA]</name>
	<desc>G.I Joe is a side-scrolling action game where you can select 3 out of a possible 5 characters to complete a mission. 

Each level is in three main parts:  The fight into the mission zone, the mission zone, and the escape from the mission zone.  The stages where you fight into and escape from the mission zone are straightforward action  just fight your way to the end of the stage, and defeat the stage boss.

The actual mission zone is a maze, where the object is to place bombs at pre-determined locations, then find and use the exit.  The mazes start out easy with the first one being only two screens high and 4 long.  Level 6 is 7 by 8 for a total of 56 screens.

Characters:

Duke (Tiger Force first sergeant/squad leader), Rock &amp; Roll (gatling gunner), Capt. Grid-Iron (hand-to-hand combat specialist), Blizzard (arctic attack soldier), Snake Eyes (commando)

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</desc>

	<name>Galaxy 5000 [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Galaxy 5000 is an isometric-perspective space racing game where 4 spaceships compete head to head in outer space races. 1 or 2 human players can compete in the races; the rest of the ships are controlled by the computer. The ships complete several laps around each course and have limited firing capacity to throw their opponents off balance. The ships can also jump. In fact, the ships can jump right off the edge of the course and drop down (in space). If the player does not complete a course in good time, the entire race track will disintegrate and leave the ship to fall down (and apparently splash into some water below).

A notable item about this game is its use of squeaky, comical, digitized voices for exclamations when colliding with another player (&amp;quot;Hey!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Excuse me!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Watch it!&amp;quot;). There are also 2 completely different control schemes that a player can adopt for cruising around the course. The first scheme rotates and drives the ship in the direction that the control pad is being pressed. The second scheme uses left and right to rotate the ship and up to thrust in the direction the nose is pointing.</desc>

	<name>Ganbare Goemon Gaiden : Kieta Ougon Kiseru [Japan]</name>
	<desc>This is a semi-humorous console-style RPG set in medieval Japan. It tells us about the adventures of Goemon, the noble thief and skillful martial artist. One day Goemon returns home and finds out his favorite smoking pipe is gone. Who could have done such a horrible crime? Goemon's friend Ebisumaru offers to help him to find out the criminal, and both embark on a journey full of adventures and danger.

Like most console-style RPGs of the time, "Goemon Gaiden" utilizes a simple turn-based battle system. You talk to town people to gather information, buy weapons, armor and items, fight random enemies, descend into dungeons and find treasures.</desc>

	<desc>This is a sequel to the  first Ganbare Goemon Gaiden (side-story) RPG. Goemon, a cunning thief and an avid treasure hunting, has nothing to do and sits in his house, bored. But his trusty friend Ebisumaru has good news: there is a big treasure to find somewhere in a big city across the sea. Of course the treasure won't be just given to Goemon: he'll have to perform a dangerous mission before. The two friends board a ship and thus the journey begins...

The game is very similar to its predecessor, as well as to most other console-style RPGs of the period. You talk to people in towns, buy various equipment, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat. The combat perspective is slightly changed in this sequel (over-the-shoulder view of the battle instead of semi-animated pictures).</desc>

	<desc>First title in the Ganbare Goemon game series of action/adventure titles. Karakuri Douchuu stars Goemon as he has to make his way through several parts of feudal Japan fending off bandits and other evil-doers.

The game is played as a side-scrolling beat 'em up, but with the added challenge of having to find the exit for the maze-like stages besides beating all the baddies. Goemon fights using his smoking pipe, but he can upgrade his weapon with power-ups found in the game or bought at several shops using the money collected from fallen enemies à la River City Ransom. Features hot-seat alternating 2 player gameplay.

	<name>Garfield - A Week of Garfield [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Garfield, the lovable fat orange cat, has gotten himself into a spot of trouble. His pal and center of abuse, the yellow dog Odie, has gone and disappeared somewhere. Their owner, Jon, is too lazy to go look for Odie himself, so he has Garfield go out and look for him. And so Garfield heads off, out into the world.

A Week of Garfield is a side-scrolling platform game based on the comic strip by Jim Davis. Garfield heads to the right through various indoor and outdoor city environments, dealing with endless vermin like frogs, birds, and mice using his judo kick skills and several different weapons such as bones that can be thrown. He has a life bar that can quickly deplete if he isn't careful, but hidden all around each stage are various items, which can replenish his health, refill his weapon supplies, and give him super speed or invincibility; be careful, though, as sometimes he'll also find fish bones which will harm Garfield if eaten.

The game is divided into seven stages, each representing a day of the week, and each with several sections. At the end of each section is a door, and Garfield must find the key hidden somewhere on the screen to unlock the door and continue. At the last door of each stage, there is a boss that must be defeated before Garfield can find the key. Each stage also has a strict time limit to keep him from dawdling, and between stages, Jon will appear to encourage Garfield or give him some advice.</desc>

	<name>Gargoyle's Quest II [Europe]</name>
	<desc>The Ghoul realm is under attack by a mysterious force and aspiring warrior Firebrand sets out to save it.

As in its predecessor, gameplay in Gargoyle's Quest II is divided into an adventure and an action part. During the adventure parts, Firebrand explores a world map and several villages from a top-down perspective, talking to his fellow ghouls and zombies to advance the story or receive important items. Action parts are seen from a side-scrolling perspective. In these parts of the game, Firebrand has the ability to jump, cling to walls, fly for a limited amount of time and shoot fireballs at his enemies. As the game progresses, Firebrand becomes more and more powerful, receiving items that improve his agility, armor or attack power.</desc>

	<name>Garry Kitchen's Battletank [USA]</name>
	<desc>Battletank is an advanced tank simulator where players take control of a tank from its driver's seat. Players are stuck straight in the tank and sent off to the battlefield in order to accomplish the mission they are assigned to.  

Mission objectives.can be anything from eliminating the enemies to destroying the enemy fuel dump to taking out an enemy camp.  However dangerous enemies lurk all over the battlefield.  Helicopters, minefields and other tanks wait to block your moves.  These enemies can move off-screen and strafe around the tank, leading to difficulties.  

However, many strategic elements are involved.  The first-person mode offers a limited view of the battlefield, and if players push the tank into overdrive it can miss the target and rush into a nest of tanks or a minefield.  Turret angle, ammunition, and tank fuel remaining must all be taken into account by the player.  To add to this, certain guns on the tank (there's 4 of them) will only hurt certain enemies.  But don't expect any help here!  Six hits and your tank is cooked!</desc>

	<name>Gauntlet [USA] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.</desc>

	<name>Gegege no Kitarou - Youkai Dai Makyou [Japan] (Beta)</name>
	<desc>Ninja Kid is a side-scrolling action game in which the eponymous kid must jump and shoot his way through a series of different levels in order to complete his quest. The assorted levels include the Poison Field, Guerrila Warfare, and Blazing Inferno. While armed with ninja bullets by default, he occasionally has the opportunity to pick up other offensive items such as ninja stars, boomerangs, or fireballs. Enemies obstructing Ninja Kid's quest include rolling eyeballs, crows, flying demons, Frankenstein monsters, and of course, other ninjas.

The game begins in an overhead map that allows the player to wander into various side-scrolling levels. The levels go on an on until the player completes a particular task that makes a door appear. Going through the door sometimes leads outside to the overhead map and sometimes leads to a boss battle.

In Japan, this game was known as Gegege no Kitaro: Yokaidaimakyo, based on an animated TV series.</desc>

	<desc>With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</desc>

	<desc>In Tecmo World Wrestling, you select from 10 fictional wrestlers and compete against the others for the coveted Tecmo World Wrestling Title. When your match begins you'll find you've got all the moves of the pros. You can run, climb to the top ropes, climb outside the ring, pick up your opponent, throw them over the ropes, pin them, and escape from a pin yourself. The wrestlers, such as "The British Star" Rex Beat and "The Technician" Dr. Guildo have a full assortment of professional wrestling moves and holds such as the Pile Driver, Shoulder Throw, Cobra Twist, as well as the ever-popular Slam the Guys Face Into the Metal Post maneuver. 

Before selected matches you'll be able to beef up you're wrestler's strength with three different exercises. The bottom portion of the screen is where the energetic announcer describes what is going on in the ring, move by move.</desc>

Bad News Baseball is a Japanese import for a younger audience. The game has two leagues - the Ultra and Super leagues - with 12 teams that represent major league cities which use fictional team and player names. There are several modes to choose from at the start of the game. You can play a One Player tournament versus the computer: pick a team and play against every other team once. Or, you can play a three-game series against a friend. There's also an all-star mode, which enables you to build a 23-player team from the rosters of one of the leagues. And if you want to watch a game, there's a spectator mode.</desc>

	<name>George Foreman's KO Boxing [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.

Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.

By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.

All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</desc>

	<name>Getsufuu Maden [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In the first years of the Demon Age, a horrible demon named "Dragon Master" was revived by his minions in hell. To protect the peace of the overworld, the two eldest Fuuma brothers fought the Dragon Master. Both were unable to defeat him and were killed, losing their legendary Wave Swords, also called Hadoukens. To avenge their deaths, the last of the Fuuma brothers vowed to slay the Dragon Master, and take back the Hadoukens.

Getsufuma Den is an action game with slight RPG elements. You travel through the overworld on pre-determined paths, which branch most of the time, leading you to shops, places where you can encounter other characters, and dungeons. Once you descend into a dungeon, you navigate your character on a platform, jumping and fighting enemies with your sword or other weapons. There are also a few first-person dungeons later in the game. In the dungeons you can collect money and then use it to buy weapons and other accessories on the overworld.</desc>

	<name>Ghost Lion [USA]</name>
	<desc>A mysterious white lion once attacked a small village and killed many of its inhabitants. But a brave soldier defeated the beast with his spear. The white lion ran away and found a shelter in a dark cave near the town. Some years later, Maria's parents organize an expedition to the cave in order to find out what the white lion really is. But they never come back...

Now Maria has to go to the cave and to search for her parents. equipped with the famous spear the brave soldier Moja used to defeat the lion, she receives the village elder's permission to descend into the cave. But while wandering through the dark corridors, she falls into a river, and a strong current brings her to the Dream World. She no longer can return back, and the fairies who inhabit the Dream World tell her that the only way to defeat the lion is to travel to yet another world - the Dark World...

In this game, you control Maria as she travels on the world maps, visits towns, and descends into dungeons. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from first-person perspective in Dragon Warrior style. Instead of party members you have ghosts you can summon to help you in battles, such as the soldier Moja and others. Hit points and magic points are called Courage and Dream, respectively. You gain levels only by finding special items, not from fighting random monsters.</desc>

	<name>Ghostbusters [Japan] (Beta)</name>
	<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

	<name>Ghoul School [USA]</name>
	<desc>In Ghoul School the player is cast as Spike O'Hara, a senior at Cool School High in a small American town. Spike is a rebel and an outcast, but is a good kid. While taking a shortcut through the graveyard home one day, he comes across a glowing skull. Intrigued, he takes it to Dr. Femur, his anatomy teacher, the next day, which happens to be the day before Halloween. Dr. Femur wants to keep it for an overnight study, and Spike reluctantly agrees, noticing that the skull appeared bigger than the day before.

During the night, the skull begins transmitting a message to the realm of the dead. On Halloween, the dead begin their assault. The teachers and students inside are turned into zombies and demons under the control of whatever intelligence has taken over the school. Samantha Pom-Pom, the head cheerleader, is captured by the dead and held somewhere inside the school. Paranormal eliminators and members of the football team have ventured inside to find her, but have not returned. When Spike learns of the mess from the TV news, he rushes to the school and decides to rescue her himself.

Spike ventures inside. The doors shut and lock behind him. There's no turning back now.

Spike begins his quest with only his trusty baseball bat and battered sneakers, but can collect better weapons and shoes along the way. Among them are the straightforward sickle, embalming fluid, towel and almighty gamma gun, the strange Deweytron and taserlike Spinal Zap, and a sandwich (if it can be used as a weapon, they should have fired the cafeteria workers a LONG time ago), among other weapons. Useful items include the spring shoes, needed to reach high places, the suction shoes, which allow you to walk on the ceiling, and the Golden Apple, needed to bypass the Medusa head guarding the way to the second half of the school.

Get going! You have 129 rooms to explore and Samantha is counting on you. Good luck.</desc>

	<desc>Mr. Gimmick is a little doll with a life of its own, that's given to a girl for her birthday. The girl's other toys quickly become jealous of the attention given to Mr. Gimmick, and they decide to carry her away to a mystical land. Mr. Gimmick goes after them to bring his owner back. 

The game Mr. Gimmick is a platform game where you take control of Mr. Gimmick over the course of six levels. You defend yourself by throwing bouncing stars that take a second to form and are then thrown downward. You can also ride the stars thrown to gain access to higher platforms. The inventory you have allows you to store bombs, potions, and fireballs.

The game has two endings. The easier way is to just run through all of the levels. Each level has a treasure hidden that can be a bit difficult to get, and finding all of these gives access to an extra level. But if you lose all of your lives and have to continue, the game will take all of your treasures away, and not allow you to get to the final level.

	<desc>Official port of "The Earth Fighter Rayiezax" originally published on NEC PC-8801.
In the year 2300, the human race created an Earth federation government and spread out into space to begin colonizing the surrounding planets. However, an alien species from the far reaches of outer space began attacking the human forces, putting the very survival of the human race at stake. Though it was only a matter of time before Earth fell to the enormous power of the enemy forces, the Earth's army commander issued an order calling all of the units dispersed around the colonized planets to return to Earth. The player takes the role of a young soldier who was stationed with the Rayieza unit on the planet Mars. The journey begins as he makes his way back to Earth along with the other members of his unit.</desc>

	<name>Godzilla 2: War of the Monsters [USA]</name>
	<desc>In a completely different style from the first Nintendo Godzilla game from Toho, you play as japanese military forces fighting against Godzilla. Because Godzilla is such a ferocious monster, this is no easy task... in fact, your attacks to Godzilla don't actually do any damage to him at all. Strategy instead becomes the main point of play as you must position forces in strategic points to route Godzilla away from important buildings and into other areas where his movement will be less destructive to the city. Actual success of these routing attacks is imperfect, if one is not careful, the whole offensive will fall apart over a single missed attack.
Beware Godzilla!</desc>

	<name>Golf Grand Slam [Japan]</name>
	<desc>This game was made with the intentions of helping the player improve their golf game. You can practice setting up putts, dealing with wind resistance, choosing a strike point on the golf ball, and other technical aspects of golfing in the two training modes the game offers. Once you feel you have enough experience you can enter the Golf Grand Slam, a tournament against 29 other fictitious pro players.

The game features 4 sets of 14 different golf clubs that you can bring to the course. The golfing is done by lining up a cursor to where you want the ball to land and then choosing the proper golf club, stance, and grip. The last step before taking the swing is finding the correct contact point on the golf ball. The contact point is represented as a dot that scatters around on top of a golf ball icon and you have to try to stop it on the part of the ball where you want your club to make contact with the ball.</desc>

	<name>Golgo 13 : Dainishou, Icarus no Nazo [Japan]</name>
	<desc>You play as Golgo 13 aka Duke Togo, ace sharpshooter and assassin. Based off a character of various manga comics, Golgo is a down-to-business man at the end of a gun. Stuck in the world of espionage among such groups as the FBI and the CIA, Golgo is constantly in mortal danger, and a lethal weapon in his own right. 

The Mafat Conspiracy is the sequel to the NES game Top Secret Episode. In this chapter, Golgo must track down a missing satellite from the SDI laser defense system, as well as rescue a top scientist and stop those who would use the satellite for blackmail and terror on the world's nations. 

While Golgo is outdoors, the game is a side-scrolling romp where the player can fire and jump. This changes when Golgo enters a building, at which point the game switches to a first person 3D maze. Navigating past soldiers and between floors, Golgo collects various clues to advance the storyline. There is also a driving sequence, and several sniper sequences in which precision aiming is required.

	<desc>The Goonies is based on a movie of the same name from 1985. A group of youngsters from a neighborhood called the "Goon Docks" are trying to find the lost treasure of One-Eyed Willie to prevent the foreclosure of their houses. Unfortunately, the treasure is buried under the hide-out of the infamous Fratelli gang, a family of ruthless criminals who are on the run from the law. You play as the asthmatic Mikey, who must find the treasure and save the other Goonies before time runs out.

The game consists of six levels. In each level, you must collect three keys to advance to the next area. These can be found by blowing open doors with bombs that are dropped by enemies. Also hidden behind doors are power-ups and other Goonies to rescue. Trying to stop you are enemies such as rats, skeletons, and even members of the Fratelli Gang. Bonus points can be gained by picking up diamonds and other valuables, rescuing the other Goonies, or by dispatching enemies with your slingshot or kicking them.

Unlike the sequel, the Famicom version was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<name>Goonies 2 : Fratelli Saigo no Chousen [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In a movie released in the 1980s, a group of youngsters formed a special gang and called themselves The Goonies.  Nintendo banked upon the movies popularity by releasing several games using the characters and music from it, including the theme song by Cyndi Lauper.  This is their second game on NES, The Goonies being released only for the Famicom system outside the United States.

You play Mikie, one of the gang members, whose friends have been kidnapped by the gangs arch enemy  the Fratelli family.  Your buddies and Annie the Mermaid must be rescued, but it wont be easy sneaking into the dark and creepy underground hideout where they are being held.  You must find a way to destroy their master computer and keep your friends from becoming road kill.  If Ma Fratelli or crazy Cousin Pipsqueak doesnt stop you, one of her two crazy sons will!

Upon starting the game, Mikie is armed only with a yo-yo and the ability to jump.  As the game progresses, he will find boomerangs, a gun, bombs, molotave cocktails and even scuba gear to help him. Fight snakes, spiders, skeletons, man-eating fish while exploring the huge world full of cellars, secret caverns and elaborate mazes.

There is more than typical side-scrolling action, although theres certainly a multitude of that.  Seventeen magic implements and many secret messages await you.  When Mikie enters a room he can talk to NPCs and try to find hidden items and doors by hitting the walls.  A password lets you keep your possessions for the next game.</desc>

Fight snakes, spiders, skeletons, man-eating fish while exploring the huge world full of cellars, secret caverns and elaborate mazes.

There is more than typical side-scrolling action, although theres certainly a multitude of that.  Seventeen magic implements and many secret messages await you.  When Mikie enters a room he can talk to NPCs and try to find hidden items and doors by hitting the walls.  A password lets you keep your possessions for the next game.</desc>

	<name>The Goonies II [Europe]</name>
	<desc>In a movie released in the 1980s, a group of youngsters formed a special gang and called themselves The Goonies.  Nintendo banked upon the movies popularity by releasing several games using the characters and music from it, including the theme song by Cyndi Lauper.  This is their second game on NES, The Goonies being released only for the Famicom system outside the United States.

You play Mikie, one of the gang members, whose friends have been kidnapped by the gangs arch enemy  the Fratelli family.  Your buddies and Annie the Mermaid must be rescued, but it wont be easy sneaking into the dark and creepy underground hideout where they are being held.  You must find a way to destroy their master computer and keep your friends from becoming road kill.  If Ma Fratelli or crazy Cousin Pipsqueak doesnt stop you, one of her two crazy sons will!

	<name>Gotcha! The Sport! [USA]</name>
	<desc>Gotcha! is an NES Zapper title based on the "sport" of paintball, and loosely tied into the paintball-themed movie caper of the same name. You are required to traverse three different battle zones, grab the opposing teams' flag from the opposite end of the field, and make it back to your flag without getting shot.

One hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.

The game contains three difficulty levels and three different zones (woods, city, snowfield) which cycle until you lose all of your lives. Numbers of enemies and their reaction time increase with each cycle. Aside from additional ammo, there are no powerups, no teammates, just you against the computer for a beat-your-highest-score challenge.</desc>

There is also the possibility to gain options, which are mysterious balls of fire that follows your spaceship closely and mimic all its movements (including shots). While you only could have 2 of them in Gradius, you now can have up to 4 of them.</desc>

You can play a one player "Ranking" mode, where you can build your boxer's stats up while climbing the ladder to eventually challenge for a championship in one of the four weight classes. There is also a two player vs. mode where you and a friend can square off. A tournament mode allows up to 8 players participate in a bracketed tournament.

Gameplay consists of each boxer moving around the ring trying to land jabs, hooks, and uppercuts. The goal is to either knock your opponent out for a 10-count or have the most points on the scorecard at the end of the allotted amount of rounds.</desc>

	<name>The Great Waldo Search [USA]</name>
	<desc>Based on the popular Where's Waldo series of books, the player's goal is to find Waldo, who is hidden in various pictures, before the time on the clock runs out. The player controls a magnifying glass and must click on various items for different effects. Finding a clock adds more time to the search, clicking on a 150 icon adds 150 points to the score, etc.

Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens containing a continuous theme. The themes are The Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The Battling Monks, The Unfriendly Giants and The Land of Waldos. Players are given the option of playing on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or playing the Land of Waldos stage. The only difference between the difficulties is that on expert there are no clock items to provide players with extra time.

In all of the stages the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. Waldo must be found before the scroll in order to complete the stage. Waldo's dog Woof is also in each of these stages (except for the Land of Waldos) and by finding him players get to play a small bonus stage where they collect points as they control the dog on a flying carpet.</desc>

	<desc>This golf game comes with pre-designed golf courses in locales such as the U.S.A., Japan, England, Scotland, Germany, Spain, France, Australia, and Hawaii. There is also an opportunity for the player to design their own golf course. The game features variable weather conditions like showers, downpours, wind, and sunshine. The game allows for both strokeplay and matchplay. It also allows for three difficulty levels: novice, amateur, and professional. Practice mode lets the player train on the putting green or on a practice hole.

Gameplay consists of aiming the golf ball and then swinging the chosen golf club. Swinging is done by a meter which measures the power of the shot and determines whether the ball gets hit straight, hooks, or slices. Putting is done with an overhead view on the green with the meter being used to measure the amount of power that is put on a putt.</desc>

Hazards include spiders, electrified wires, ground-mounted hazards, and a boss at the end of each level.

It's a suit of flight armor that allows the guardian to survive any environment.  It's a good thing too, because a giant space station is spotted on a collision course with Earth.

You take the role of the guardian.  Your mission is to activate the station's self-destruct and destroy it before it collides with Earth.  As you travel through the station NAJU, you'll find increased armor and better weapons to help you defeat waves of enemies.

Throughout the levels there are five diamonds you must collect which are needed to complete the final level and rescue Jennifer, with plenty of obstacles and enemies to get in the way. During the game Mr. Stevenson continuously walks to the right and you have to use the light gun to save him from any obstacles blocking his path. Some obstacles can be destroyed with the light gun, others Mr. Stevenson will need to jump over (shooting him with the light gun will cause him to jump.) You have a limited amount of ammo, but more can be obtained by popping the balloons which are scattered throughout the levels.</desc>

The game is a compilation of familiar types of gameplay. The first stage is a helicopter aerial battle similar to Top Gun. The second stage is a first person side-scrolling shooter like Operation Wolf. The third stage is a maze hunt with influences from Golgo 13.

	<name>Gun.Smoke [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out.

Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a railway line.

On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.</desc>

	<desc>Quinn Hart and his partner, Detective Reese of the VICE squad both work to stop the trafficking of illegal substances. But something new has appeared on the scene, a neon gel with great addictive properties. During investigations as to the origin of the gel, Reese mysteriously disappears and leaves Hart without a lead. Time passes and Hart becomes romantically involved with his new partner, Christy, as he continues trying to track down the gel. But Hart is about to get a brand new lead...

Vice: Project Doom is a game that features both overhead driving modes and side-scrolling platform adventure sequences. Hart's vehicle can accelerate or slow down and fire his weapon straight ahead. During side-scrolling sequences, Hart can jump, duck, climb or use his selected weapon. Weapons that can be selected include a Katana sword, a pistol and a grenade-type weapon. These weapons feature limited ammunition with the exception of the katana. Power-ups include ammunition, coins, and health.

During both of these sequences, Hart must fight and maneuver his way past enemy foes to confront a boss. By destroying the boss and completing the level, Hart progresses and learns a bit more about the origins of the neon gel and what Project Doom is all about. Cinematics dialog between the levels tell the tale in a style similar to that of Ninja Gaiden.

You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</desc>

	<name>Hammerin' Harry [Europe]</name>
	<desc>In the peaceful town of Carpentersville, some workers known as The Rusty Nailers decide to bulldoze a house that belongs to Harry. Harry is certainly not happy with this, and goes on a rampage, destroying workers that get in his way. As Harry, you can destroy workers in one of two ways: you can smash them when one of them gets near them, or you can pound the ground, and by doing this, you will send shockwaves in both directions. 

There are four environments in which Harry needs to get through: construction sites, sewer, ship, and the mansion where Harry meets the leader who ordered the demolition of his house. At the end of each environment, a boss needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next environment. In between these, there are bonus stages in which you have to destroy a number of enemies before time runs out.</desc>

	<desc>In this snowboarding game, the player goes on various runs completing events on downhill mountains. There are five events in all: Downhill, Slalom, Half-pipe, Moguls and Backwoods.  In Downhill the object is to get down the slope as fast as possible. In Slalom you have to guide the board between the gates. In halfpipe, you have to perform stunts on a half pipe. In Moguls, you have to jump over both small and large moguls. In Backwoods, you'll be given different obstacles to contend with and you'll have to find away to get around them.

You also earn points by executing various stunts along the way. Stunts you can pull off are a toe grab, hand-plant, mid-air 360, and a mule-kick.

There are three different peaks, each featuring a couple different runs. The mountain ranges consist of Poseur Peak, Scary Summit, and Mt. Mortified.</desc>

	<desc>Ufouria is a (side scrolling) platform adventure video game. You begin play as Hebereke (Bop Louie in PAL regions), a penguin (though in PAL release he is more humanoid and looks like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man), and must explore the world on which you and three other friends crash landed. As you encounter the new characters you must fight them to make them recover their memory.  Once you have recovered all 3 other characters you are then searching for Temple Keys which will lead back to your homeworld of Ufouria.

The world in which you interact is free form, meaning that you can wander around as you please. To get to new areas you will need to get power-ups and/or new characters with their own abilities. Character switching is done as needed, not defined by levels.  Sections of the game have bosses and mini-bosses which include the characters which have not had their memory returned yet.

She can defend herself with the use of a large mallet. Running into enemies will make her cry, which causes Kitty to get angry and lose a life. Points in the game are collected as money for the cash register. Allowing the time limit to expire will also cause the player to lose a life. However, there are infinite continues and losing the game score is the only penalty for "game overs." There are 18 stages in the game and the game does not repeat itself after the 18th stage. While the second half of the game is more difficult then the first nine levels, they can be cleared once the player is accustomed to the game controls.</desc>

	<name>Hello Kitty World [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The little kitten Kitty, her kitten friend Mimi and their bear friend Tippy love playing with balloons. One day, Tippy has inflated a whole bunch of balloons when suddenly a strong wind blows. Tippy is blown away! The only way for Kitty and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her rescue.

Hello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid  a forced side-scrolling platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.

Throughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airbourne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water. Some enemies can only fly by holding balloons, and just like in Balloon Fight, these can be disposed of by touching their balloons.</desc>

Starting in Athens and wandering all over ancient Greece (and even the mythical land of the dead), you'll have to fight many monsters, including popular figures from Greek mythology like Talos or Hades, and prove yourself worthy of a hero's fame.

The game is very similar to  Dragon Warrior series: you fight random enemies in turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective, collect experience and money, and in towns talk to people and buy weapons, armor, and items. There is no world map in the game, but a continuous location complete with towns and dungeon-like areas.

Your first assignment is to go to Athens and to find the famous poet Homer who can tell you about the way to defeat the Titans. During your journey you meet many characters from the Greek mythology, including Daedalus, Cerberus, and Hephaestus, and recruit interesting creatures to fight at your side, such as the half-horse Centaur or the Woman Without Soul. You'll also encounter real people from the Greek history, like Homer the poet or Hippocrates the doctor.

The gameplay is similar to  Dragon Warrior style: you travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, talking to people, and fighting random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. An interesting innovation is a full day/night cycle. Locations look different at night, and it is sometimes necessary to visit them at different times.

	<desc>The grand master Juan was robbed of the secret scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, which is the ultimate kung-fu stance that gives the impression of a flying dragon when in effect. Luckily Juan has entrusted the remaining scroll to his worthy student, Ryohi. Juan's last request was for Ryohi to visit Shorinji. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji, took the young Ryohi under his wing.  Six years later, a letter of challenge is sent from the Tusk Soldiers, who are the enemies of Shorinji, The letter mentions the upcoming "World Tournament of Contact Sports". Ryuhi decides to take part in the tournament as a representative of Shorinji. Ryuhi also hears from  Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who robbed Ryuhi's master of his scrolls and now Ryuhi plans on getting them back.

The player controls Ryuhi. During the side-scrolling portion of the game the player can use kung fu to dispose of enemies. There are also miniboss type enemies (the screen turns black when they appear)  that must be defeated because they drop items that must be collected in order to continue on. The items they drop go in a sequence of power-ups which will eventually allow you to get a key to exit the level. There are some one on one duels during fighting tournaments that involve hitting a target on an opponents body while defending the target on Ryuhi's body.

	<desc>Hissatsu Doujou Yaburi is an RPG - beat-'em-up hybrid that casts you as a novice martial artist that sets out to roam the ancient Chinese countryside in order to hone his skills and earn fame and fortune.

Starting from your village, you must explore your surroundings by walking and jumping across the land in simple side-scrolling fashion, that is until you run across an enemy (fellow martial artists, bandits, ghouls, etc.) and enter combat mode, which allows you to unleash attacks based on your skill level to try and defeat your opponent (always using the 2D side-scrolling engine).

Victory will earn you money and other bonuses which can be used back in town to upgrade your skills and regain health. You can also enter special tournaments found as special buildings across the land in which you must defeat a series of opponents in succession before facing off against the reigning champion. Victory here will reward you with even more money and will mean more people will recognize you in your travels.</desc>

You have to run quickly through the levels (there is a time limit), punching and kicking your enemies, causing them to fly away or to explode, occasionally meeting a boss, visiting secret areas behind doors and collecting various power-ups. 

This is in fact the second game in the series; the first one was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<desc>Randy, the Holy Diver, is setting out to retrieve the five emblem seals belonging to the King Crimson Family in order to expel the greatest evil, the Black Slayer, back into another dimension.

Holy Diver is an action game much in the vein of Castlevania. The player controls the Diver as he uses magic powers such as shooting energy balls and freezing time to traverse the game's eight levels. Enemies throughout the levels respawn and there are destroyable objects in your path. At the end of each level a tougher boss character must be beaten. Once defeated a power-up spell becomes available to the player. To use these spells the player must pause the game and select it from the inventory menu. The player has the ability to shoot horizontally as well as up. Difficult paths may sometimes be crossed by the combination of the right spell at the right time such as the freezing spell that freezes quicksand. 

Though scheduled for release in North America, the game never went beyond its release in Japan.</desc>

	<desc>In the far future, the apocalypse has come and gone. Now people leave peacefully in rural cities making the best of the advanced technology that survives and trying to win back the world day by day. Ark City, the crown jewel of technological advances, has managed to put back into operation a super computer capable of taking control of every aspect of civilization, right down to weather and mind control. This does not bode well for the people of the world, so you as an ESP-gifted warrior take it upon yourself to journey to Ark City and get rid of this threat.

Hoshi wo Miru Hito is a classic NES-era RPG, in which you navigate your party (composed of you and 3 other ESP-wielding heroes you can find) in a top-down world map, chat with NPCs in towns, buy weapons and armor, and finally journey into dungeons to gain clues that help you in your journey.

Combat whisks you away from the top-down perspective to a battle view in which you see your opponents and heroes in a first-person perspective, and assign actions in turns, with the ESP powers taking the place of magic spells.</desc>

	<name>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is based on the Robert Louis Stevenson novella "Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", which follows a respected doctor who develops a serum that transforms him into the embodiment of his darkest thought and desires. He becomes a slave to his alter ego and is ultimately destroyed by it. 

In the game, Jekyll must make his way from his home to the church where he is to marry his sweetheart Miss Millicent. He's got to keep his life bar and "Jekyll to Hyde" meter in check, or he'll find himself changed into the nefarious Mr. Hyde. If this happens, Hyde must then defeat enough baddies to raise the meter back up and allow the good doctor to continue his quest.</desc>

	<name>Adventure Island [USA]</name>
	<desc>In the South Pacific, Master Higgins lives peacefully wearing only a grass skirt and a cap. That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

	<name>Adventure Island II [USA] (Beta)</name>
	<desc>In Adventure Island II: Aliens in Paradise the player takes the role of Master Higgins who has to save his cavegirl from aliens which also want to dominate the Earth. The basic gameplay elements are the same as in its predecessor Adventure Island: Master Higgins walks through the levels while fighting against various enemies. One hit results in his untimely death unless he carries one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero.

A big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don't have to be used instantly but can be saved for later: before every level the player can choose the power ups he wants to bring with him. There are overall eight worlds with different themes which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes there are different paths with other level and at the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a boss.

	<name>The Hunt for Red October [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Soviet Union have been building in secret a Typhoon-class submarine with nuclear strike capabilities. This war machine has been named the Red October. While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. 

You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</desc>

	<desc>After the evil dragon lord Varalys tried to enchant the princess Ann, he was thought to be defeated by a brave warrior. But evil can never be defeated once and for all - once again, a curse has fallen upon the land, and you, a nameless young boy, is the only one who can save it. Equipped with your magical sword, you must roam the land of Hydlide and defeat the evil once again.

This is the second NES game of Hydlide series ("Hydlide 2" was only available for the MSX platform). You can choose one of the four character classes to start the game with, and also upgrade your class during the game. The combat is action-based: you can either attack your enemies by ramming them with your weapons, or cast magical spells. In towns there are equipment and items to buy.

	<desc>In Ice Climber one or two players need to climb their way to the top of 32 different mountains. Each mountain is broken up into eight levels of platforms along with a bonus stage at the top. Attempting to stop you from making upward progress are different creatures ranging from polar bears to condors as well as treacherous landscapes with falling icicles, moving platforms, and icy floors. To help out, your only weapon is a mallet which can be used to knock out enemies as well as bust away bricks in the platforms to give you some room to jump up to the next level. When you finally reach the top, it's time to move on to the next, more difficult level.</desc>

	<name>Ice Hockey [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Ice Hockey is an action game for one or two players. Start of by selecting a team and customizing your players. Each team member can be one of three player types: small and skinny (very fast, but not good at checking or shooting), very large (slow, but with a strong body check and outstanding shooting strength) or average (medium speed, with average checking and shooting strength). After the teams are set up, it's time to play some ice hockey! Gameplay features a scrolling screen to follow the action, and lets you choose which of the players you wish to control when on defense (on offense you always control the player with the puck). Fights can break out between players, and the loser may end up in the penalty box. There are five different speed settings for the game, and periods can be either 7, 10, or 15 minutes long.</desc>

	<desc>In Tiles Of Fate the object of the game is to clear the screen of all the tiles within the given time limit. This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges!</desc>

	<name>The Immortal [USA]</name>
	<desc>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of 
isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.

The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.</desc>

In The Incredible Crash Dummies the player alternates between Slick and Spin as they go through five levels with each level containing 2 stages (except for the 4th level which only consists of one). One of the Dummies' legs has been replaced with a wheel while the other Dummy has his legs intact. So the main difference in gameplay is that in some stages the player either rolls throughout it or walks throughout it. The Dummies' arsenal includes an air gun which stuns enemies at close range and an oil gun which shoots and kills enemies at a far range. There are also a few powerups scattered throughout the stages such as the arrow, balloon, and arm powerup.</desc>

	<path>/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/nes/Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Europe).zip</path>
	<name>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade differs from the two other games with the same name as it is a hybrid of various genres such as platform action, motorcycle racing, puzzle solving and even some adventure elements.

In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade you play Indy's role in his search for the Holy Grail, but this time it is you who chooses which step he will take at each part of his quest. For example, in the very beginning you receive a diary about the Grail from Indy's father, who is in Venice. At the same time, you receive a telegram from Marcus saying that the Cross of Coronado is in Portugal on a ship called Coronado, and that he'll meet Indy there. So you have to choose what you'll do first: go to Venice and check about the Grail and your father, or go to Portugal to find Marcus and the Cross of Coronado.

In the entire game you'll be prompted with these choices, each one leading to different stages throughout the game. Each stage presents different game genres. For example, in Venice you find a scrambled picture of the Grail, and you have to try to put it back together, just like you'd do with the pieces of a puzzle. Besides, in the platform stages, Indy has plenty of movements, as he can punch, kick, walk, run, jump and use his whip.

The game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.</desc>

	<name>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade [USA]</name>
	<desc>As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary. 

This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.

	<desc>The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade game based on the second movie in the series.

Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.
With every cycle the mine &amp; mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.</desc>

	<name>Jackal [USA]</name>
	<desc>The enemy army has captured too many of your forces. Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war... unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals...

Jackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your gernades (upgradable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you'll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress.</desc>

	<desc>The main goal of the game is to get the most points. Before you can play, you must first enter your birth date and a PIN number consisting of four numbers. After that, you must enter a name. Once you're ready, you can pick one of five players and start. There are a few games in a session, and after each session, points are either awarded from you and/or the other three players. 

Jangou is a game which plays similar to Mahjong. It was ported to many consoles including the Famicom in Japan.</desc>

	<name>Jaws [USA]</name>
	<desc>Loosely based on the fourth movie "Jaws: the Revenge", players take control of a ship to sail the ocean in the search for the killer shark.  Along the way, the ship will stop to allow a diver to swim out and kill baby sharks, jellyfish and manta rays to find conch shells.  The conch shells are used to buy upgrades for the boat.  Extra conch shells can be earned in bonus rounds where a sea plane flies over the water to bomb jellyfish (think the bonus rounds of Galaga with reversed perspective).

The diver will battle Jaws several times in an attempt to wear down his life meter.  If the player is lucky, they can find a submarine to increase their firepower and defense.

If the diver manages to wear down Jaws' energy, they take back to the boat again, launching strobes into the water in an attempt to lure the shark out of the water.  If close enough, the player can use the boat to ram Jaws in an attempt to kill him and win the game.</desc>

	<name>Jeopardy! [USA]</name>
	<desc>Gametek's faithful NES recreation of the long-running international quiz show. Up to three contestants can play at once, with gaps optionally filled in by computer AI. If three human players are engaged, then Player 1 and 2 share the first controller, with the second controller going to Player 3.

For the first two rounds, six categories with five questions each are randomly selected by the computer to populate the game board. The contestant who answered the last question correctly gets to pick the category and a dollar value, with harder questions being worth more money. Players have ten seconds from the time a question appears to "ring in" with the appropriate controller button and answer. 

Answers are built by using the controller to navigate around a grid of letters and "type" out the correct answer. Spaces and punctuation are ignored, but spelling and grammar generally must match the expected answer exactly. The contestant has 30 seconds to provide the answer before "time is up" and the other players have the opportunity to ring in.

Final Jeopardy consists of one category, which players bet their current winnings on being able to answer. A single question from that category is asked after the hidden bets have been placed. Again, each player has 30 seconds to provide their answer while the other players are instructed to look away. At the end, scores are tallied and the winner declared.

Categories in this edition draw from general knowledge and do not follow a specific theme (like the sports or Star Wars editions). Each category will always consist of the same five questions, and the game draws on a limited number of categories. Repeats will appear after a handful of sessions played. Some questions "current" for 1987 will also be less obvious decades later, and more difficult than intended.</desc>

	<desc>Based on the television game show of the same name.  The 25th anniversary edition of this quiz show requires you to provide 'questions' in response to the 'answer' clues.  The harder the question the more money it is worth.

You can play with 1-3 players.  If less than 3 players are competing they may choose whether or not to play against the computer.

Three skill levels provide  40, 45 or 50 seconds allowed to key in your answer.

The first part of the "question" (WHO IS...or WHAT IS...or WHAT ARE, etc.) will appear with a number/letter grid (not QWERTY).  You response must be the EXACT spelling and tense that the system is looking for or it will not be accepted as a correct "question".</desc>

	<desc>A conversion of the popular TV game show for younger players ages 7 and up.

Up to three players can take part in the three-round trivia contest where the answers are given and the contestants must supply the correct question.

In the first two rounds, six categories of five answers each are randomly chosen by the computer to fill the "wall" and the player begins by choosing any one of them.  After the chosen answer is given, the first player to hit his "buzzer" gives the response using the controller to move a cursor over an onscreen keyboard, spelling out the question within the time limit.  In the final round, a category is announced and the players each place a bet, up to the limit of their winnings so far, on the final question.  After all players are ready, the final answer is shown and all players give their questions.

There are three difficulty levels and the computer can supply opponents if desired.</desc>

The two probes, Comet and Corona, are to launch from Space Lab Jesus and collect a sample of the gases in the tail of the comet, and determine if life on Earth was brought by this comet as some have speculated. However, communication has been lost with the probe Comet; what could be going on?

Jesus is a Japanese-style adventure game. Each area is shown with an image, and you have the option of several commands. The player takes the role of Japanese pilot Hayao Musou, a member of the crew, and attempts to solve the mystery surrounding Comet and Halley's Comet.

	<name>The Jetsons : Cogswell's Caper! [Europe]</name>
	<desc>The Jetsons: Cogwell's Caper is based on the well-known Jetsons property from Hanna-Barbera. In this spin-off adventure, George Jetson is tasked my his employer to put a stop to the profit-making schemes of the rival Cogswell's company. To do this, George must hop from location to location in his jet and conquer each level using the resources available to him, as well as with the assistance of the other Jetson franchise characters.

Cogswell's Caper is a side-scrolling action game where George Jetson can walk, crouch, and jump (actually, he's too lazy to jump and a jet pack handles the jumping duty for short bursts). Each level is littered with crates and other items that George can pick up and toss at enemies, while finding useful items (and occasionally even more enemies) underneath them. Since the game is set in the futuristic world of the Jetsons, there are also copious switches on walls which activate all kinds of features of the surroundings, such as a switch that reverses gravity for a brief time.

	<desc>In Tiles Of Fate the object of the game is to clear the screen of all the tiles within the given time limit. This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges!</desc>

Select your team's home city (there is no NFL or NFLPA license, so there are no real teams or players) and then battle the opposing team for four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  Graphics are simple: one team has blue uniforms, the other team red ones.  The human player gets control of the quarterback on offense and the middle linebacker on defense.  The play perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling.  Choose from 9 offensive--mostly passing--plays and 6 defensive plays.  Teams have 9 players each.</desc>

	<name>Jordan vs Bird : One on One [USA]</name>
	<desc>Two of the greatest icons of the Golden Age of the NBA match up in this game. On one side, the spectacular dunks of Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls; on the other, Larry Bird's incredible accuracy from the outside. 

While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal, each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts from the judges, and win the competition.

While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird's stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan's speed and jumping abilities?

	<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>

	<desc>The evil scientist Warunachi has hacked all the otherwise peaceful robots in Japan and now plans to launch an attack for world domination the likes of which the world has never seen. Fortunately his former partner, Dr. Eamon, saved one robot from the takeover and has now programmed him to defeat the other robots and foil Dr. Warunachi's evil plans.

Joy Mecha Fight is a one-on-one 2D fighter, in which you control a robot and attempt to defeat your opponent by attacking him with your basic moves and special attacks triggered by specific control motions. Each robot is composed of six hovering segments: the head, torso and limbs, which hover around each other forming a basic humanoid shape. 

The game features story, instant fight, and Vs modes. In the story mode you start with the Sukapon robot, and as you defeat other robots they become available for selection as you advance through the story with all moves being explained via a pre-fight tutorial if you want to.

It is a platform game with a lot of various levels: jungle, underwater, volcanic caves, on the ice... Toki's only weapons are spitting on the enemies or jumping on them and crashing them. There are many possibilities to upgrade his spitting "weapon";  for example, if he finds an upgrade, he can spit fireballs.

Players can compete in stroke play with up to four players, or match play against a friend or the computer. When playing against the computer, the player will play against an opponent that uses metal clubs, which hit farther than the standard wooden clubs.

In addition to stroke and match play, players can obtain passwords that allow a replay of any spectacular shots that are made (eagles, holes-in-one, and double-eagles).</desc>

	<name>Jurassic Park [Europe]</name>
	<desc>One of many different titles based on Steven Spielberg's 1993 dinosaur thriller, the version for NES and Game Boy is a top-down action game with exploration elements.

Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player must work through six levels by completing certain objectives including rescuing the kids Tim and Lex, restoring power, destroying Raptor nests and finally getting off the dinosaur-infested island. To advance in a level, a number of dinosaur eggs scattered over the area must be collected or destroyed. This will reveal a passcard used to gain entry to buildings, or some other items necessary to complete the assignment. The park's computer terminals can be used to request hints on where to go next.

Naturally, the levels are full of hostile dinosaurs. Dr. Grant can fend them off with his gun. Several ammunition types are available, varying in damage and shooting patterns. Killed dinosaurs will always drop the most basic ammo type, the others must be found. Next to ammo clips, there are boxes with question marks on them to be collected. These might include beneficial powerups like a health increase, but can also be dangerous and reveal a bomb.

Some levels end in boss encounters, including a Triceratops stampede and a fight against the Tyrannosaurus Rex.</desc>

	<desc>The town of Astholm is protected by a Sapphire, one of the magical stones mentioned in old legends. Generation of honorable priestesses protect the stone, and with it the town. Tonight is the annual Sapphire Festival, and the young priestess Firis is going to conduct the ceremony. But just after the joyous event, the priestess is kidnapped by Gel du Rey, the henchman of the evil Lord Ezelkiel. You play the role of the captain of Astholm's guards. You and Firis have been close friends ever since the childhood. You decide to rescue the priestess, with the help of your loyal guards and friends you meet on your journey.

Just Breed is a hybrid of traditional console-style RPG like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy, and strategy RPG. During confrontations with the enemies, the battle screen occupies the entire location, and large parties of allies and enemies fight each other in turn-based style, moving on the field to perform physical attacks (melee as well as ranged) or to cast magic spells.</desc>

	<desc>Metal Storm is an action game in which the player takes control of the giant mecha M-308 Gunner in order to put a stop to a malfunctioning computer menace. 

To save it from becoming another generic action game, innovation is shown through fast paced gameplay and the "gravity flip" ability, which enables the character to freely switch between moving along the floor or ceiling. While the game is only seven levels long, the difficulty ramps up quickly, so mastery of the gravity technique and memorization of the levels become absolute necessities for survival.</desc>

	<desc>In the 21st century, the evil Emperor Garuda has taken over the city of New York, killing many of its inhabitants. You play as either Hayate or Kaede, two ninjas who are attempting to free the city from Garuda's control.

Shadow of the Ninja is a typical side-scrolling action game, consisting of running, slashing and jumping through 5 levels, each with 4 sub-stages with numerous and varied foes, and a boss enemy at their end.

Kaede and Hayate can not only jump; as ninjas, they can hang from platforms and make swift saltomortals between floors. Sometimes, canisters containing powerups can be found. Typical powerups extend range of the default sword, or they may be additional weapons such as throwing stars and a ninja weapon that looks like a big grappling hook on a string.

The game allowed two players to play cooperatively, a rare feature for action games outside of the Contra series.

	<desc>You play Kage, a skillful ninja in search of rescuing Princess Kiri from the hands of the warlord Yoshi.  Armed only with a sword and 'star knives', you must fight your way through countless henchmen and the occasional boss to complete your task.  Levels include the forest, moat, inside and outside of the castle.  These levels repeat as the seasons change.  The gameplay is side scrolling.  Kage's moves include the ability jump extremely high in the air, grab and climb trees, block and attack with his sword, and throw shuriken.  The game can be challenging at times though because the player dies in one hit.  2-players are supported, but must take turns.</desc>

	<desc>The legend of Kaguya-hime is one of the most popular stories in Japanese mythology. Once upon a time, an old man went to the forest to cut some bamboo, and found a little baby girl. He took her to his house and named her Kaguya-hime. She grew up there, and soon became the most beautiful girl of Japan. Many young men, including the son of the emperor himself, tried to conquer her heart, but for no avail. One day Kaguya-hime confessed she was a moon angel, and returned back to the moon. In this game, you control the son of the emperor, and you'll do your best to reach Kaguya-hime and to protect her. You must overcome various obstacles and meet characters from Japanese folklore.

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure: all the actions are performed by selecting commands from the menu, including moving from location to location. You view the locations from first-person perspective, but there are also parts where you navigate your character from a  top-down view. Beside the usual adventure commands such as "look", "take", or "use" (an inventory item) there are some more original actions available under "extras", such as "kiss", "attack", and even "undress".</desc>

	<desc>One day, a mysterious theme park called Karakuri Land appeared in Edo. In it were various mechanical attractions, built around different themes. Many people went to visit, and the park was very popular. The princess asked Yanchamaru if he would like to go with her, but since he was busy with his training, she went by herself. However, she didn't come back, and so Yanchamaru must make his way through the oddly-aggressive attractions to find and rescue the princess!

Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2 is the sequel to Kid Niki, and once again stars the big-headed, sword-spinning, headband-sporting fighter Yanchamaru. Each stage is based around a theme, such as a world built from cakes and a world built from volcanoes, and each is filled with animatronic enemies, with a boss at the end. Yanchamaru has his trusty spinning sword, and can also find bonus items to improve his abilities and increase his score.</desc>

	<desc>The princess has been kidnapped again, this time by a pair of menacing-looking figures. Locked in a tower, she manages to write a plea for help on a scrap of paper and then sends a paper airplane out of her prison. Miraculously, it reaches her boyfriend Yanchamaru who, being the upstanding samurai that he is, immediately sets out to save her.

Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 is the final sequel to Kid Niki and is a significant departure from the first two games. Not only does the game feature full four-way scrolling and large maps to explore, but Yanchamaru himself sports a completely new look and numerous new abilities. His trademark spinning sword now seems to more closely resemble a bo, and Yanchamaru can now use it to shoot waves of energy at foes, bounce on the end, spin in place, and even launch off of walls and corners. Taking a cue from Mega Man, he also now has the ability to slide through narrow spaces and underneath dangerous spikes.

Each stage contains numerous keys and locked doors. Any key will open any door, and it is possible to complete a stage without even finding all the keys and doors. The final door in each stage leads to the boss room. After clearing each stage, your performance is tallied, and depending on what you did, bonuses such as points or lives are given.

	<desc>Kid Kool is a side-scrolling platformer.  The king is sick and Kool must gather the seven magical herbs to cure him within three days.

Unlike most platformers, momentum is very important in Kid Kool.  He takes several steps to get up to full speed when running and cannot stop on a dime.  There is no air control, so how far he is able to jump depends entirely on how fast he was going when he left the ground.

Kool faces a variety of enemies.  They can be defeated by jumping on their heads.  The first jump drives them into the ground and the second eliminates them.  They also can be beaten with a furry companion that Kool can pick up by running fast enough past the appropriate spots.  He can be thrown with the B button, then retrieved by standing near him.  He also affords some protection as if Kool is hit while holding him, he will only lose his companion, not a life.</desc>

	<name>Kame no Ongaeshi - Urashima Densetsu [Japan]</name>
	<desc>It's the year 2777. Due to nuclear wars and natural disasters, Earth's population has decreased dramatically and only five island are left, forming the nation of Xexyz. In Xexyz, humans, spirits and faeries have lived peacefully for centuries under the reign of King Xeu Star. One day, Xexyz is attacked by Goruza who murders the king, builds mechanical castles on each island and captures the queen of each island. You take on the role of a soldier named Apollo who wants to put an end to Goruza's reign.

Controlling Apollo, it is your task to free all five islands. Freeing an island is done in several different phases that feature 'Jump'n Shoot' as well as 'Shooter' levels (called "Action Mode" and "Shooting Mode"). The first level of each island is a Jump'n Shoot level that contains many doors to shops, bonus games, friendly NPCs or mid-bosses. NPCs will sometimes give you important hints, items or weapons; bonus games can be played to win some money ("Balls"); defeating mid-bosses (and thereby freeing a Fairy) will get you a cash reward and shops also offer weapons and items. Weapons differ largely in attack power and range. Items have temporary effects such as invincibility or improved jumping abilities. In an island's first level, you will have to find a secret room and defeat a boss, for which you will receive a Force Star that is needed to gain access to a mechanical castle. Mechanical castles look similar to other Jump'n Shoot levels but are more complex.

Once you have made your way to a "Cyborg Rider", a self-scrolling Shooter sequence starts in which you have to shoot your way through lots of enemies while picking up speed and weapon power-ups.
At the end of this sequence you will leave the Cyborg Rider, and step onto a floating platform for a boss fight. After the boss is defeated, another Shooter sequence with another boss at the end awaits, but this time, the boss if fought from the Cyborg Rider. After defeating this boss, you start the process over with a Jump'n Shoot level.</desc>

	<name>Kamen no Ninja : Hanamaru [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Kamen no Ninja Hanamaru is a side-scrolling platform game by Capcom. Hanamaru, a ninja boy in training, is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre happenings and disappearances. In a local theme park called Leisure Island, children have been mysteriously disappearing and these disappearances are being attributed to a ruthless rival gang of ninjas. Equipped with his red mask and a mechanical hawk, it is up to the brave Hanamaru to journey throughout the park's fourteen areas and to rescue the captive children. The young ninja can run, jump or allow his hawk companion to attack enemies at long range. He can also collect special scrolls to increase his magic powers and cast various spells (press Down and B to activate them) - they range from lightning attack (kills all enemies on screen), ground shake (kills all enemies on the ground), Fire Hawk (unleashes the hawk super dive attack) and super jump (increases jumping speed for a short amount of time). Various special items are also available throughout the game, such as extra lives, invincibility and battle cards. Battle cards are a very important part of the gameplay - every now and then, Hanamaru encounters a boss that he must fight in a really unusual way (and apparently loosely based on the traditional Japanese disciplines of Ninjutsu). Boss battles are round based, and the player must pick a card with a higher face value than his opponent, and the difference represents how much damage the player (or the boss) takes. Thankfully, Hanamaru can collect special battle cards along the way - some can double or triple the face value of a card, whereas others prevent the boss from being able to attack for a round, or help Hanamaru regain some life. Although most of the game offers traditional side scrolling platformer action, several levels try out very different gameplay styles (Hanamaru can ride a Skateboard in some stages, or fly through the air with the help of his hawk companion).</desc>

Kick Master is a side-scrolling platformer in which enemies are defeated by using various kicks and spells. Defeated enemies drop three items that refill Thoalon's health or magic, grant an extra life, damage him or increase his experience. When Thoalan gains a level, his maximum MP is increased and he learns new kicks, such as sliding, flying, roundhouse or butterfly kicks. Along the way, he can also pick up different spells that damage his enemies, protect him or refill his health.</desc>

	<name>Kick Off [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top down view and unlike other football games of that time the ball was not glued to the feet of the players. Playing Kick Off requires skills in boll control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.</desc>

	<name>Kid Icarus [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Far away in peaceful Angel Land lived a young angel warrior named Pit, who has been given the task of defeating the monstrous Medusa, who wishes to destroy Angel Land and all of the people, and she has started by kidnapping Palutena, the Princess of Angel Land.

Young Pit must rescue the Princess and restore peace to Angel Land. He will travel from the deep caverns of the Underworld to Medusa's palace in the sky on his journey, and deadly monsters will attack him every step of the way. But he has the power of the Gods on his side! A powerful bow and arrows, Water of Life, and Angel Feathers will assist Pit on his quest to destroy Medusa and save the princess!

Kid Icarus is a platform game where the player goes through several vertically outlaid levels, shooting enemies with his bow on the way and collecting hearts they leave behind. Pit's bow can shoot both forward and upwards. As Pit continues upwards, more and more of the level ends up beyond the bottom of the screen and if Pit falls down out of the screen, he dies. 

The levels contain doors which lead to chambers of various types - some chambers are filled with enemies, some are treasuries which allow Pit to obtain a power-up, some are stores where Pit can buy stuff, some will replenish his health, in some Pit will be able to take a test in hopes of getting a powerful weapon, and finally some chambers give Pit a chance of receiving a strength upgrade, therefore increasing the amount of damage his attacks deal. 

Pit earns experience as he defeats enemies, and he gains levels from this experience. The more levels Pit has, the more maximum health he has. 

Hearts taken from enemies are used in shops to buy various items and power-ups. Items include a protective shield which harms enemies, a more powerful bow, a mallet which allows you to smash the poor Palutena's warriors turned to stone who will later help you to fight a boss, a torch to see yourself in dark areas and others.</desc>

	<desc>Kid Klown and his family are on their way to perform in a circus when they meet the magician Night Mayor. He asks Kid Klown to help him open a treasure vault, but Kid Klown, having been warned about the evil magician by his parents, refuses. Not willing to give up so easily, Night Mayor kidnaps Kid Klown's family and dares him to follow him into his world if he ever wants to see his family again.

Kid Klown in Night Mayor World is a side-scrolling platformer. Kid Klown has to complete several different stages inhabited by various enemies. His most helpful tools are his balloons that he can throw at his enemies, use as a trampoline or cling to in order to float through the air. 

There are various items to be picked up as well, including bonus lifes, health power-ups, strawberries, lightnings that make Kid Klown temporarily invincible and question marks that can have the same effect as any of the other items, but might also reverse the controls.

After every completed stage, a bonus game can be played in which Kid Klown may win items by throwing balloons at them. The number of balloons available depends on the number of strawberries collected in the previous stage.</desc>

	<name>Kid Kool and the Quest for the Seven Wonder Herbs [USA]</name>
	<desc>Kid Kool is a side-scrolling platformer.  The king is sick and Kool must gather the seven magical herbs to cure him within three days.

Unlike most platformers, momentum is very important in Kid Kool.  He takes several steps to get up to full speed when running and cannot stop on a dime.  There is no air control, so how far he is able to jump depends entirely on how fast he was going when he left the ground.

Kool faces a variety of enemies.  They can be defeated by jumping on their heads.  The first jump drives them into the ground and the second eliminates them.  They also can be beaten with a furry companion that Kool can pick up by running fast enough past the appropriate spots.  He can be thrown with the B button, then retrieved by standing near him.  He also affords some protection as if Kool is hit while holding him, he will only lose his companion, not a life.</desc>

	<name>King's Knight [Japan]</name>
	<desc>King's Knight is a fantasy-themed top-down shooter where four heroes have to unite to defeat a dragon and rescue a princess in despair. It was one of the first games published by Square Soft (now one-half of Square Enix). King's Knight is a variation on Konami's Knightmare which sold extremely well.

The first four stages involve you powering up your characters as far as they can go, picking up shields (to increase defense), boots (to increase speed), swords (to increase attack power), and spell icons (which will be required to be held by everyone for the final storm on the castle), defeating monsters along the way. The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. Nearly everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:

Ray Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power;
Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping;
Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and
Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly.

It is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage, because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the party members has died.</desc>

However, while he was gone, an evil wizard called Mordack uses a spell to warp his castle out of Daventry, along with the royal family. Soon after, Graham came back, only to realize that the castle is gone. After he wonders why, an owl called Cedric speaks to him about it and transports him to the land of Serenia, where his boss Crispin helps him get ready to face up to Mordack. Cedric is asked to go with him to make sure that Graham does not get in trouble.

	<name>The New Zealand Story [USA]</name>
	<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you control Murobo, a kobold fighter. One day the queen tells you an evil demon is preparing to conquer the land of Villgust and to being death and destruction to all people. You are the only one who can save the world, but you need to be strong and to find comrades, such as cat-like fighters from a nearby town, to help you on your difficult quest. 

Loosely based on an animé series Villgust, the game is a mixture of traditional RPG with platform fighting. Every time you encounter an enemy, you have two options: combat and auto-combat. Auto-combat makes you and the enemies attack in turn-based style, without you being able to interfere. If you choose the combat option, a platform pops out, on which you and your enemies appear. Both your party and the foes can jump and attack in close combat and from a distance.

	<desc>You get your choice of 16 teams to play, eight domestic teams and eight foreign teams from Asia and Europe. In One-Player mode you play the computer in an international tournament. For Two Players, you each have a squad in the tourney. All games are seven innings long.

To help you pick a team, Power Analysis screen enables you to see how teams rate on hitting, pitching, overall defense, and running.

When you're up to bat you can move around in the box, control your swing, and bunt. Pitcher's have a choice of fastball and changeup, and curving the ball left and right. On defense, all players can dive for balls or jump up to snare line drives. A great defensive plus here is the ability to move players into pre-set defensive shifts, for example, to defend against pull hitters or bunts

The gameplay and artistic style are heavily influenced by the NES Mega Man games (some contend the elements are "borrowed" or "stolen", in fact). The game is a side scroller in which the heroine can wield a variety of different offensive capabilities (all available from the start of the game), selectable via a subscreen in her quest to wipe out wave after wave of robot invaders throughout the four levels. You also have a limited range broomstick at your disposal for riding across chasms and such.</desc>

Chinese Hero is a top-down action game for one or two players, both playing on the same screen. Each ninja has the ability to move in any of four directions: up, down, left and right, as well as punch directly in front of them and do a "Moon Sault Kick" (which can be powered up to a "Miracle Kick") whereby they jump and somersault directly in front. Both punches and the Moon Sault Kick can harm enemies. Defeating a certain number of enemies on each level will open the doorway into the next level. Occasionally extra passages (named "Quick Passage Zone") can be found to take shortcuts through areas with stronger enemies. At times, defeated enemies will leave power-ups behind which either player can collect in order to increase their abilities temporarily. While power-ups are diverse, here are examples of some of the effects: weakening specific enemies, invincibility, increased attack, extra lives and the ability to use projectile attacks.

The game looks and plays pretty much as the original with you controlling a lead character across a side-scrolling court and  having minimal control of whether the AI players pass or shoot the ball. Unique to the sequel are more extensive fighting options and the ability to dash and jump, which opens up a whole new arsenal of moves.

New graphic features include weather effects and different courts to play in. As with the original the game supports 4-player gameplay and includes a league mode (1P tournament), Vs and a special penalty shootout vs mode.</desc>

	<name>Labyrinth [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Labyrinth is a maze game similar to Gauntlet, but with a more definite goal and some adventure elements. It is based upon the Jim Henson film of the same name incorporates many scenes from the movie as areas with the maze.

The goal of the game is to collect twelve coins Sara can use to buy back her baby brother from his kidnapper, the goblin king, Jareth. There is one coin in each of the twelve mazes surrounding the central castle. At first only a few of the mazes are accessible; however, upon collecting a section of a broken key, of which there is also one per region, Sara is sent to a hub where a friendly goblin will open up a new area. Each section of the maze has its own gimmick, for instance the Hedge Maze rearranges itself as the player wanders through it, and the Fieries' Forest is filled with teleports. The areas are also connected via a large underground maze. Upon gaining all the sections of the key Sara can open the door to the castle and enter the final series of mazes, however, she cannot win if she has not collected all of the coins.

Throughout all this Sara is constant beset by enemies at which she must throw a neverending supply of stones to dissipate.  Her stones can be upgraded eventually and she can also gain the favor of her friends from the movie who will follow her around and try to help her shoot at her aggressors.

All of this must be done in no more than 13 minutes or the game must be restarted, and every time an enemy attacks Sara she loses a few more seconds.  However, there are several ways to gain more time, and part of winning the game is balancing actually solving the maze and spending time searching for minutes to do just that.</desc>

	<name>Lagrange Point [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In 22th century, mankind has left the Earth. A new space epoch began, called the Isis era. Human beings built an oasis in deep space, a space station called LaGrange Point. From there, they could send expeditions to remote planets and to explore the space. You control a young pilot named Jin. One day, when you descend into LaGrange from your space ship, you are attacked by mysterious robotic invaders. Your task is now to travel through space and to find out the cause of the assault. But you don't even suspect you'll soon be involved in a deep mystery that was destined long time ago...

"LaGrange Point" is one of the few old-school console-style RPGs to be set in a science fiction environment and to feature space flights. The combat system requires you to use special points (called BP) in order to perform simple attacks, cast spells, and use various techniques that will cost you your HP. You fight random monsters and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, like in Phantasy Star series.</desc>

	<name>Last Armageddon [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.

Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic  Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.

Dungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.</desc>

The action takes place in outer space from a side-scrolling perspective where the ship always remains lined up in the middle of the screen but is able to turn forwards and backwards while accelerating and decelerating. The ship can also collapse into a slimmer configuration. Enemies come at you from all directions and in all formations. Shoot them as quickly as possible while also disabling the enemy fleet's starcruisers as best you can.

The game also features a 2-player mode where each player takes turns fighting the armada.</desc>

The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.

Legacy of the Wizard is an side-scrolling action platform game with role-playing elements.  The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.

The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-resoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</desc>

Kage's moves include the ability jump extremely high in the air, grab and climb trees, block and attack with his sword, and throw shuriken.

	<desc>In 1990 , Arcadia games. Licensed by Nintendo. 
Although, here is another fine game that never made it on the shelves. This game was in production, unfortunately Kevin Costner's movie was also in production at the same time.
This proved bad timing on Arcadia's behalf.

This game was in the final stages before release. At this vital time Kevin Costner's movie was released. Robin Hood, prince of thieves. But Arcadia didn't have the funds to obtain licensing from both Nintendo, and the movie, they were forced to pull out. The game itself is a lot of fun, it's an action RPG and it shows the life of all the Merry-Men.</desc>

	<desc>In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.

The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. 

Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. 

There are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. 

To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. 

If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the "2nd quest", which is essentially a harder version of the game. 

The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.</desc>

	<name>Legendary Wings [USA]</name>
	<desc>Legendary Wings is an arcade shooter influenced by Greek mythology.  A heroic figure from ancient times thrust into a strange futuristic world, you must fight your way through six levels to defeat "The Devil" and save the day.

The primary gameplay mode is a top-down, vertical-scrolling shooter similar to Xevious and Capcom's own 1943.  Your main weapon is used to attack flying enemies, and your secondary missile weapon is used to attack fixed placement, land-based enemies.  Numerous powerups are available along the way, and these both improve your weapons and your resistance to damage (every "upgrade" is worth a free hit from enemies without dying).

Several secondary gameplay modes (Danger, Lucky, and Palace) are also triggered at key points in the vertical-scrolling mode.  All of the secondary modes are side-scrolling shooters.  The Danger stage requires you to face a gauntlet of enemies, while the Lucky stage is full of powerups, game continues, and other bonuses.  The Palace stage is triggered when you defeat a mini-boss; you must get past the palace defenses before you can face the end-of-stage boss.  And, oh yeah...don't get crushed by those walls!</desc>

	<desc>This baseball game features 30 all-time great baseball players (only 6 are pitchers). There is an exhibition mode which is just a single game and a tournament mode where you pick your players and then the computer pits you against the others in random made teams; win and you advance on to the next game. 

Pitching is done by a behind the batter view. The pitchers can throw the ball with three different speeds; slow, medium, and fast. Also, the fielders are controlled manually.

You can also choose between an old classic style stadium or a new modern style one. Besides the actual look of the place the only real difference between the two is that it's easier to hit a homerun in the old style stadium.</desc>

	<desc>Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>

	<desc>You get your choice of 16 teams to play, eight domestic teams and eight foreign teams from Asia and Europe. In One-Player mode you play the computer in an international tournament. For Two Players, you each have a squad in the tourney. All games are seven innings long.

To help you pick a team, Power Analysis screen enables you to see how teams rate on hitting, pitching, overall defense, and running.

When you're up to bat you can move around in the box, control your swing, and bunt. Pitcher's have a choice of fastball and changeup, and curving the ball left and right. On defense, all players can dive for balls or jump up to snare line drives. A great defensive plus here is the ability to move players into pre-set defensive shifts, for example, to defend against pull hitters or bunts

Ariel has already met Eric, and they plan to wed, but the sea-witch Ursala has taken control of the ocean!  So Ariel (After explaining what's going on to Eric) becomes a mermaid once more and sets off to rescue the sea.

The game takes place from a side view and Ariel (Swimming most of the time, but hopping around on the land occasionally) can shoot bubbles to trap her foes and can then throw them at each other.  She can also dig through sand to find treasure and pick up sea shells to help her break chests open.

The treasure she finds in the sand is usually just bonus points, but the treasure you find in chests will increase your bubble's power and range.

	<desc>Blu Boltar, lord of the Yoma clan has invaded Chinaland and captured the Emperor. Sending out a TV broadcast across the realm, Blu Boltar declares himself the ruler. Jack and Ryu are the ninja masters of Chinaland, training under their mentor at Mt. Epin. Having heard the news of the Emperor's capture they set out to defeat Blu Boltar and his Yoma Clan.

Little Ninja Brothers is the second game in the Super Chinese series and the first to be a role-playing game. Players, controlling either Jack or Ryu, explore the world map in an overhead view. Random encounters with monsters will give the option to flee or to fight. During combat, gameplay resembles the first Super Chinese game, where players move their character up, down, left and right... and can either punch or do a somersault jump to damage enemies. Additional power-ups, can also be found during the course of battles. Successfully defeating enemies awards experience points and Sen money. Jack and Ryu share experience points so they remain at the same level. A second player can join in at any time and share the experience level of the first player. Sen is the currency of the world and can be spent in the convenience store of each town to increase abilities and buy new weapons. Some of these include throwing stars, special martial arts techniques, swords, projectile attacks and other special powers. Towns also contain people who will give clues and information to Jack &amp; Ryu.

When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack &amp; Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.

Little Ninja Brothers also features a field meeting mode where Jack and Ryu compete in a variety of sports themed events themed around a foot race. The different modes available for this competition include: a regular Dash, Popping Baloons, Athletic Obstacle Course, Finding a treasure hidden inside rocks, Eating food attached to balloons and finally, Shooting targets with projectiles.</desc>

	<name>Little Samson [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Ta-Keed, the Prince of Darkness, has managed to escape from his supernatural penitentiary where he has had centuries to plot exactly how he will take revenge on those that locked him away. Emperor Hans sends his troops to deal with this threat, but they are no match for the ultimate evil one. As an alternative, the emperor summons the bearers of 4 Magical Bells. These 4 adventurers must make their way to the castle and work as a team if they are to destroy Ta-Keed.

The first part of Little Samson has each of the 4 characters journeying from his or her home land to the emperor's palace. This gives the player an opportunity to explore that character's unique abilities which will be essential throughout the game.

1. Samson is a human who is reasonably fast and also possesses magnificent rock climbing prowess. He is able to scale walls and hang across ceilings, and also grab onto walls and ceilings while jumping. His offensive option is the ability to shoot bells straight ahead.

2. Kikira is the Dragon Lord. Since she has claws, she does not slip on ice. When she jumps, she can also fly for short bursts. She breathes fire in 2 intensities, depending on how long the player holds down the fire button. Her fireballs spread in arc patterns.

3. Gamm is the Rock Lord. Since he is a living rock he is very strong. So strong in fact that spikes do not hurt him, which is very valuable in a number of situations. He is also very slow and has only a short leap. He has a powerful punch.

4. K.O. is the Mouse Lord. He is tiny which allows him to enter areas that other team members can not. He is also extremely fast and the highest jumper of the team. However, he is the weakest member so he can not sustain very much damage. He has the same wall and ceiling traversal abilities as Samson. Offensively, he can drop time-delay bombs.

When all 4 characters reach the emperor's palace, they all jump into Samson's bell. Actually, Gamm and K.O. quietly jump into Samson's bell; Kikira initially refuses. After a brief fight (with the player controlling Samson), Kikira joins the effort. Throughout the rest of the game, the player can switch between any of the 4 characters by entering the sub-screen. Each character has their own power meter. However, all the characters share lives. If the presently selected character loses all of his or her power, then one life is lost. The player must swap between all 4 characters in order to complete the journey.</desc>

	<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

	<name>The Lone Ranger [USA]</name>
	<desc>In the early 1880's in Texas, a man has returned to bring  justice to the outlaw who murdered his brother and his former comrades, the Texas Rangers. His name is the Lone Ranger. The outlaw, whose name is Butch Cavendish, has now kidnapped the President. The time has come for the masked man to begin his journey of adventure for the purpose of safely rescuing the President and avenging the deaths of his brother and former comrades.

The game takes you through 8 western-themed regions, each 
with a different objective, all of which brings you closer to your nemesis, Butch Cavendish. The game features many points of view during gameplay. Most of the time, the game is played from a top-down perspective, as you travel through the country and walk through towns. At other times, the game switches to a side scrolling view when you are in a boss stage. On occasion, the view switches to a first person perspective and plays similar to a first person shooter.

Each bad guy you kill is worth money. You can use money to buy more bullets, dynamite, rifles or a patch up from a doctor. For example, you start with a short barreled gun which you can upgrade to either a medium or long barreled gun. Your gun shoots standard bullets but can also fire silver bullets which are stronger than the standard ones.</desc>

	<name>Loopz [USA]</name>
	<desc>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.

Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.

Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. 

Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.

The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</desc>

	<name>Lot Lot [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Lot lot is a puzzle game. The goal of the game is of extreme simplicity. Manipulate the balls in such a way till they fall into the pits and generating points.

The game has five pits: Out, 0 points, 10 points, 30 points and 50 points.

Each level starts by giving you a target score that you'll have to reach before you continue to the next level.

The screen is divided into sixteen sections. The walls of those sections randomly disappear and the balls will then drop or roll into the other section or a pit at the bottom of the screen.

On the screen you will find two arrows of which the second arrow follows the first one but with a slight delay and it stops at the same position as the first one.

The arrows will start in an empty section of which one of the walls will soon disappear. To move the balls to the empty section move your first arrow to a section that is filled with balls end press the space bar or fire button. The balls will then be moved to the empty section.
If both sections contain balls then the balls will be swapped accordingly.

Now you have to manipulate the balls in such a way that they will generating points by getting them to the pits that generate points.

In the bottom left of the screen there is a section that has a thin red line at the bottom. Never move the balls in that section because if any balls enter that section a crab will appear and cut the red line with it's razor sharp claws. The balls will disappear in the pit labeled 'OUT' and you loose a life.</desc>

	<desc>Lupin III: Pandora no Isan (????? ??????? Rupan Sansei: Pandora no Isan?, "Lupin the Third: Legacy of Pandora") is a video game for the Family Computer based on the popular Lupin III series by Monkey Punch and is a sequel of sorts to the film The Castle of Cagliostro. It was developed by TOSE and released by Namco under their Namcot label on November 6, 1987 in Japan only.

The game is somewhat similar to Namco's earlier released arcade title, Rolling Thunder, with the addition of multiple gadgets and the ability to switch between the three main characters. Lupin and his allies can find other characters in each stage who can be bribed for information. The persistent Zenigata also makes an appearance, present in each stage, attempting to arrest Lupin.</desc>

	<name>M.U.L.E. [USA]</name>
	<desc>M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.

You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.

Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.

After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.

After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.

Third phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. 

There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are:
- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it.
- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.
- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).
- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.
- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.
- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.
- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.
- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.

M.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. 

M.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.</desc>

	<desc>M.U.S.C.L.E. (Millions of Unusual Small Creatures Lurking Everywhere) is an early NES wrestling game based on the line of toys popular in the 1980s. M.U.S.C.L.E. allows you to choose two wrestling stars from the M.U.S.C.L.E. universe (from a selection of eight) in a tag-team match tournament in one player mode, and versus a friend in two player mode. Each wrestler has one special move that can be used by collecting the power pellet that floats around the ring at random instances.

	<desc>Mach Rider is a motorcycle combat game set in a post-apocalyptic future. Players, represented by Mach Rider, must make their way across ten sectors to reach the city before it gets taken over by the enemy. Aggressive drivers try to force players off the road; obstacles, such as rocks, and the road's many turns also can cause players to veer off course. If destroyed, Mach Rider will reform himself so that he can continue.

There are three different play modes in Mach Rider.

On the Fighting Course, there are two paths to choose from. The goal must be reached while shooting down enemies or forcing them off the road; more points are rewarded by bumping off enemies. Unlimited lives are available for the first stage, but remaining courses must be finished in three lives or less.

On the Endurance and Solo Courses, there is a certain distance that must be gone before the time runs out. Enemies are on the Endurance Course, but the Solo course is devoid of enemies.

There is also a level editor (similar to the one in Excitebike) that allows creation of Endurance Course tracks, which are erased once the NES is turned off.</desc>

	<desc>You play as Golgo 13 aka Duke Togo, ace sharpshooter and assassin. Based off a character of various manga comics, Golgo is a down-to-business man at the end of a gun. Stuck in the world of espionage among such groups as the FBI and the CIA, Golgo is constantly in mortal danger, and a lethal weapon in his own right. 

The Mafat Conspiracy is the sequel to the NES game Top Secret Episode. In this chapter, Golgo must track down a missing satellite from the SDI laser defense system, as well as rescue a top scientist and stop those who would use the satellite for blackmail and terror on the world's nations. 

While Golgo is outdoors, the game is a side-scrolling romp where the player can fire and jump. This changes when Golgo enters a building, at which point the game switches to a first person 3D maze. Navigating past soldiers and between floors, Golgo collects various clues to advance the storyline. There is also a driving sequence, and several sniper sequences in which precision aiming is required.

	<desc>Totally Rad is an action-adventure game in which you play Jake, a magician wannabe being trained by the Master Magician Zebediah. One day, during his training, Jake is attacked by surprise by unknown foes who kidnap Allison, his girlfriend. Then, Jake has to save her and discover what lies behind that attack.

This game is a side-scrolling one, with the basic controls common to many of those games that fall in the same category: moving, jumping and shooting. Your basic weapon is something like an energy ball that can be charged by holding the button for a few seconds until its maximum power. Although Jake is supposed to still be learning his magic from Zebediah, from the very beginning you can use all his magical powers. You can select which magic you want to use from a list, displayed when you press the start button. The magical powers available include healing, time stopping, invincibility, the power of the elements (fire, watter, wind and earth) and 3 different metamorphosis. You can morph into a flying guy who throws something like a boomerang (that doesn't come back), a fish-like guy, who throws something like ninja stars and can swim, and a feline-like guy, who releases electrical shocks from his hands and becomes invincible while jumping. You do not evolve during the game, as your health and magic bar doesn't grow.

Totally Rad, as the name points out, is a game full of slang, with the constant use of words like totally, gnarly, dude, excellent, decent, righteous, etc.</desc>

	<name>Magic Johnson's Fast Break [USA]</name>
	<desc>Magic Johnson's Fast Break is fast-paced two-on-two action rather than the usual five-on-five contest. On screen you get a full-court, horizontally-scrolling gameplay. A referee monitors the action and calls the fouls if the gameplay gets too rough, and a crowd cheers you on.

Your team starts each game at a certain salary level. Your goal is to beat the opposition to earn a larger salary. Keep winning and you might etch your name onto the Big Earners Screen. Choose from five skill levels - Rookie to Professional. Each level provides quicker gameplay, tougher defense, and bigger bucks if you win.

Each game lasts four three-minute, real-life quarters. In between quarters, you can review stats such as field goal percentage, three-pointers made, rebounds, and steals. If the score is tied at the final buzzer, you play additional quarters until someone wins.

You control one player at a time. An arrow appears on-screen above the head of the player you're running. Just hit B to switch players. You can play against the computer or up to three friends.</desc>

	<desc>The evil wizard Sabaron summoned a horde of demons to invade Arabia. One brave magician tried to fight Sabaron, but was trapped in the holes of time. This magician is you. Traveling through different time periods, you'll have to stop Sabaron's evil plans and to rescue the beautiful princess Scheherazade he kidnapped.

"Magic of Scheherazade" is a mixture of action- and turn-based combat RPG styles. Wandering through Arabia, you'll encounter enemies whom you'll fight in real time, using various weapons. You'll also be attacked by enemies with whom you'll engage in strategic, party-vs.-party combat. You can choose from three character classes: Fighter, Saint, and Magician. Each class has its own special abilities that you'll use in battles as well as during your exploration of the game world.</desc>

	<desc>The Krion Empire chose the year 1999 in which to stage an invasion of earth. The planet's defenses were no match for the alien robot invaders. Fortunately, a witch named Francesca has taken it upon herself to single-handedly free mankind from this scourge.

The gameplay and artistic style are heavily influenced by the NES Mega Man games (some contend the elements are "borrowed" or "stolen", in fact). The game is a side scroller in which the heroine can wield a variety of different offensive capabilities (all available from the start of the game), selectable via a subscreen in her quest to wipe out wave after wave of robot invaders throughout the four levels. You also have a limited range broomstick at your disposal for riding across chasms and such.</desc>

	<desc>Merlwood was once a land of peace and prosperity. The people lived in harmony with one another and with their surroundings, thanks to the benevolent influence of the native wizards and their magical arts. All was calm until one ambitious wizard named Abadon began to lust for power. Abadon overwhelmed the other wizards, brought evil upon the land, and made himself its master. Only Paul, a young magician's apprentice, was left to oppose him. Can you guide Paul to victory, or will Abadon rule Merlwood forever? 

Magician is a 2D, side-scrolling action RPG. As Paul, you must travel through towns, have conversations with non-player characters, acquire and manage inventory (food, water, weapons, potions, etc.), learn magic spells, fight battles, and solve puzzles. Your ultimate goal: collect each of the four elemental vials -- earth, air, fire, and water -- and combine them to create the Ultimate Potion. Only then can you hope to vanquish the evil wizard Abadon!</desc>

The name of the weapon is Mag Max and only it might be able to defeat the alien invaders. Mag Max however is incomplete and for security reasons, his component parts are scattered across the land. Through their collection, Mag Max's strength increases.

Mag Max is a side-scrolling shooter game. At the beginning, Mag Max is only a tiny little fighter craft that can fire low-powered projectiles. As component pieces are found; such as a head, legs and a laser lance, Mag Max's offensive power increases. Access to the underworld can be granted through small dark craters on the landscape. Once in the underworld, Mag Max's weapons vary slightly as do the enemies (there are no stationary objects underground). Enemy fire or contact on each of the components will destroy that component. Fire on the main fighter will destroy Mag Max. At the end of each level awaits a boss creature.

	<name>Major League Baseball [USA]</name>
	<desc>Baseball game featuring full major league rosters of all 26 teams of the 1987 baseball season.  The players, however, are never identified by name, only by jersey number.  Oddly enough, the statistics for the players are very close to, but not exactly, the same as their real-life counterparts.  Close enough that it is possible to identify who each player is supposed to be, though they are represented only by a position (infield/outfield/catcher/pitcher), a number, and a stat line.

There is no season mode, but you can play a regular season game, an All-Star Game (you pick your own All-Stars from the team rosters), or a World Series.

Before each game begins, you set your lineup and starting pitcher from your chosen team's roster.

Gameplay is the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for pitching and batting, switching to different views after the ball is hit.</desc>

Arthur the brave knight must rescue his beloved Princess from the Demon King Astaroth and his forces - amongst them are the various undead (ghosts, zombies), bats, ogres and goblins. Other challenges include moving platforms, ladders and water/fire hazards. 

As in most games in this genre, the player can pick up power-ups such as daggers and bombs during the course of the game, giving the player greater firepower.

	<name>Maniac Mansion [Europe]</name>
	<desc>The Edison mansion has always been a creepy old house on the edge of town. There have been rumors of strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.

Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.</desc>

	<name>Maniac Mansion [Spain]</name>
	<desc>The Edison mansion has always been a creepy old house on the edge of town. There have been rumors of strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.

Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.</desc>

	<name>Mappy Kids [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Mappy the mouse had a son named Happy. Happy has grown up and now wants to settle down with a wife. However, the girl he wants to marry won't agree to marriage until Happy can prove that he can provide for a family. So now it's up to Happy to collect a small fortune so he can please his would be spouse. Of course, the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of mukies stand in the way of making this an easy endeavor.

The game is a basic sidescrolling platformer. Happy can defeat his enemies by kicking them. He can also perform a jump, and while he's up in the air, he can spin his tail so he can glide in the air for a short period of time, which is useful for clearing large chasms. Littered throughout the levels are treasure boxes and coins which earn money for Happy, which in turn can be spent on items for domestic living. On the other hand, every time Happy is hit by an enemy, he loses some money, though a money bag will appear allowing Happy to recollect some of the lost money.

After each stage, Happy is presented with a slot machine ran by Nyamco. First, Happy spins the wheel to see a prize. Prizes range from extra lives to domestic items. Now, to actually win these  prizes, Happy must go up against one of the Mukies in a minigame. If he fails to win the minigame, he can be penalized by losing some money, domestic items, or even a life. Minigames include waving flags by following Nyamco's orders. There's also a  minigame where Happy stands back to back with a mukie and they try to push each other off a platform.  The other minigame involves trying to spot more differences in a picture than the opponent can.

After the minigame is over, Happy goes to a shop, where he can purchase items for his house. Buying these items will prove to the bride to be that Happy is worth marrying.

The two player game has both players, (one playing as Happy, the other as his brother Rappy), competing against each other to collect the most assets to prove their worth as a suitable husband.</desc>

Unfortunately the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of pink cats want to track Mappy down so they can make a meal out of him. The goal of the game is to collect 6 of 1 item in each stage without getting eaten by a cat. The items you collect (either pieces of cheese, wedding rings, christmas trees, or baseballs) vary depending on what stage your playing.  There are also stage specific items in the background that will help you defeat your feline adversaries.

The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</desc>

	<name>Mario is Missing ! [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Bowser, the token bad guy from the Mario Bros. series, is up to no good again in this educational game designed to teach children geography. This time he's set up his headquarters in Antarctica and created portals to 25 famous cities around the world, so that his Koopas can wreak havoc in our own world. He's also kidnapped Mario, hence the title of this game. You play as Luigi who must foil Bowser's plans by entering through each of the portals, tracking down the Koopas who have stolen famous artifacts, and looking for clues about your location. Once you've set everything right and determined where you are, you call Yoshi on your Globulator so he can track you down. You need Yoshi's help to eat the Pokey (a cactus-like creature) that's guarding the return portal, and when Luigi returns he can close the portal forever.

By exploring these 25 cities, children can familiarize themselves with the landmarks and artifacts that each city has. When Luigi returns the stolen artifacts to the proper places he can even take photographs of them. There is also an add-on disk you can purchase that adds ten additional cities to the game (it originally retailed for $24.95).

	<desc>In NES Open Tournament Golf, you can play a round of golf on one of three different courses. One or two players can play in the U.S., Japan, or the U.K. and choose a stroke or match play game. Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook. If you are unable to finish a round in one play, NES Open Tournament Golf features a battery back-up allowing you to save the game and continue later.</desc>

	<desc>Long ago the Crystal Palace was a thriving kingdom, however the evil war spirit Zaras appeared one day and brought destruction to the lands! The people of the Crystal Palace left as Zaras and his henchman took over, changing the kingdom into a maze of many dangers. You control Farron, the hero of the story who needs to enter the Crystal Palace and destroy the bad guys in order to restore peace. The game is an action platform game that scrolls both horizontally and vertically. On each of five stages you'll need to fight various enemies throughout the varied terrain, and finally defeat the boss at the end. You'll start with just a simple sword, but additional weapons can be found or bought in order to help you out. If you get into trouble, you can also call your dog Zap onto the screen; he'll jump around causing damage to the enemies giving you a chance to escape. You may also come across Kim's shops along your journey. Here you can buy various items, including additional  lives, replenish your health, more powerful weapons, and other useful items. To purchase items, you'll need money which can be collected after defeating enemies in battle.</desc>

Stakk'M is a Tetris like game that uses falling square blocks with either numerals, hearts, or diamonds patterns on them. The player tries to create either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines of 3 to 5 identical or consecutive numbers to score points and eliminate them from the well. Each level has a goal that must be met in order to move on to the next level. Goals involve completing a set number of horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines, scoring a stated number of points, or eliminating a certain number of blocks at once by using any combination of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines. There are also treasure blocks which act as wild cards and death blocks which can only be eliminated by combining them with other death blocks.

The HES version of this game does away with Pyramid and Double Strike and adds the following games in their place:

	<name>Mechanized Attack [USA]</name>
	<desc>Mechanized Attack is an adaptation of an arcade shooting game where the player uses a machine gun to stage an assault on a tropical island that's home to a cyborg army. In this NES port, the player can use either a gamepad or the NES Light Zapper to carry out the mission. Battle through numerous stages beginning with an approach to the island. This first stage is held over the water and features at attack on a number of small gunboats, a helicopter, and an entire battleship. As the player progresses through the stages of the island, the human (and even canine) enemies are revealed to be robots when the flesh is destroyed. At various junctures of the game, the player is allowed to choose which game path to pursue.

While the arcade version of Mechanized Attack had a miniature machine gun replica for the player to use, this NES adaptation attempts to reproduce the feel by allowing the player to hold down a game pad button or the Light Zapper trigger for automatic fire. Extra ammo is plentiful so be sure to fire at those power-up boxes to grab as much as you can. There are also more powerful grenades which are in much shorter supply than the bullets.</desc>

	<name>Mega Man [Europe]</name>
	<desc>In the future city of Monsteropolis, the use of robot labour has helped civilization grow more than ever before. At the forefront of this technology is Dr. Light and his assistant Dr. Wily, who are commissioned to build six robots to handle a variety of specific tasks. They are named Bombman, Gutsman, Iceman, Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman in reference to their individual prime functions. Dr. Wily, however, has bigger plans and chooses to take control of the robots and let loose destruction in a bid for world control. Dr. Light fights back with the best tool he has, an experimental human-like robot, Rock aka Mega Man, who had been tested to perform cleaning duties. Now properly armed, it's up to Mega Man to take on the maverick robots, fight his way into Dr. Wily's castle, and end this madness.

Mega Man is a side-scrolling platformer. Mega Man has the ability to jump and fire his weapon. He must travel to the levels of the six robot masters and defeat them in combat. By doing so, Mega Man is able to acquire their power for his own. These powers can then be used interchangeably with his main weapon and target the weaknesses of specific enemy bosses. Additionally, some hidden areas of the levels can only be accessed by using certain captured robot weapons. A special  Magnet Beam ability can also be found which can be used to create steps. 

Travelling throughout these levels, Mega Man is confronted by an army of lesser robot creations. Destroying these usually yields energy capsules (for refilling Mega Man's Energy), weapon capsules (for refilling Mega Man's special robot weapons), and extra lives shaped like Mega Man's head.</desc>

	<name>Mega Man 2 [Europe]</name>
	<desc>After defeating Dr. Light's six robots that were reprogrammed by the villainous Dr. Wily in Mega Man, it seemed like the world was safe.  But it was not to be.  Dr. Wily has escaped from prison and is madder than ever, this time creating eight new Robot Masters of his own to take over the world and crush Mega Man!  Is the world doomed?

Mega Man 2 is the sequel to the NES game Mega Man. In this game, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man and Wood Man are Dr. Wily's eight prize creations that have been sent to take over the world.  As Mega Man defeats these bosses, he can steal their powers and use them for himself.  Each Robot Master is weak against another's weapon, and through experimentation, Mega Man can gain the upper hand by using the weapon they're vulnerable against.

Other additions to the game include the 'E-Tank' - an item that can be used at any time to completely refill Mega Man's energy, and a Password System, which allows players to continue their game by recording which Robot Masters have been defeated and how many E-Tanks they have.  Mega Man 2 also removes the scoring system from the original game.</desc>

This is a traditional action-platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Also, there is a mysterious character called Protoman who may or may not be your friend.

Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.

How do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels, even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows: Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, &amp;amp; Hard Man.

Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. And, of course, you do get infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.</desc>

As Dr. Light begins to investigate this rampage and attempts to find a way to stop it, he is kidnapped by the leader of the robots.

	<desc>Kickle Cubicle is a Lolo type sliding puzzle game where the Wicked Wizard King covered the kingdom with ice and hid the people and palaces deep within the ice.

Armed with his freezing breath, Kickle sets out to save his friends and attempts to rescue the kingdom from this puzzling predicament of perpetual winter.

Each level has a fixed time limit and enemies that will try and block your progress. The four lands (Garden, Fruit, Cake and Toy) have 17 or 18 puzzles in each. Beat all of those and there is a Special Stage with 30 more challenging puzzles.

Your main options are to move, make a block of ice and slide a block of ice.

Objects appearing in puzzles include: 

1. Rock: You cannot go over these but you can use them to stop sliding ice cubes.
Slippery Ice: Enemies can not go there.
Base Rock: These can not be destroyed and enemies generate from them.
Spring: Springs an ice cube across the screen.
Water Hole: You can't fill or walk across these holes in the ice.
Breaker: Shatters ice cubes that strike its corners.
Hammer: Changes ice cube direction and hits enemies.
Power Rock: Hit this and all enemies will freeze.</desc>

	<name>Mermaids of Atlantis: The Riddle of the Magic Bubb [USA] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>Corrected version of Bubble Bath Babes which was an adult-oriented puzzle video game developed by C&amp;E. Although the game was not licensed by Nintendo, it is designed for play on the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is one of three pornographic themed games released by Panesian, along with Hot Slots and Peek A Boo Poker
The gameplay is reminiscent of that of Tetris and Puzzle Bobble in that the goal is to steer clusters of rising bubbles and place them so that they connect to other bubbles of similar color along the top of the screen. If the sufficient number of similar bubbles are touching, they will be cleared and all free neighboring bubbles will rise further, allowing for combos. If the accumulated bubbles on screen reach the bottom of the playing area, the game is over. If a level is completed, the player will be rewarded with erotica.
The original version was released by C&amp;E themselves under the title Magic Bubble in 1991. It was licensed to American Video Entertainment, who released it in the same year under the title Mermaids of Atlantis, with all pornographic elements removed or obscured. A localized version leaving all pornographic content intact was released by Hacker International in Japan as Soap Panic and by Panesian in the United States as Bubble Bath Babes.
The game is very difficult to find and is sought after by collectors, often topping prices of $1000 U.S. Dollars on auction sites such as eBay.</desc>

As FOX-HOUND's (an elite black ops unit) newest recruit, going by the codename of Solid Snake, your mission is to infiltrate Outer Heaven and rescue your missing comrade, Grey Fox (who was captured after a failed infiltration), while gathering intelligence on Metal Gear. In order to fulfill your objective, you must collect various weapons and equipments (including keycards for further access into the fortress), while avoiding visual contact with the enemy. The player must also confront against bosses in the form of Outer Heaven's elite mercenary force and rescue hostages hidden within the fortress in order to increase their rank, which gives the player an extended life bar and increased storage capacity for replenishable items and ammo. The player can use a wireless transceiver to come in touch with their commanding officer, Big Boss, to learn more about their current mission objectives or contact one of the local resistance members operating covertly within the fortress to gain useful tips and insights.</desc>

	<desc>Metal Storm is an action game in which the player takes control of the giant mecha M-308 Gunner in order to put a stop to a malfunctioning computer menace. 

To save it from becoming another generic action game, innovation is shown through fast paced gameplay and the "gravity flip" ability, which enables the character to freely switch between moving along the floor or ceiling. While the game is only seven levels long, the difficulty ramps up quickly, so mastery of the gravity technique and memorization of the levels become absolute necessities for survival.</desc>

	<desc>In the future, the Galactic Federation and the pirates of planet Zebes are at war. Pirates have stolen an unknown life-form, recently discovered on the planet SR388. The life-form, designated "Metroid", is in a state of suspended animation and, according to analysis, was the cause of the complete destruction of SR388. If the Metroid ever got loose, the alien could destroy countless other systems. It is up to the space bounty hunter Samus Aran to land on Zebes and find her way through the perilous terrains of Brinstar and Norfair, destroy the Pirates, as well as their alien enforcers, Ridley and Kraid, and rid the planet of the alien life form before the pirates complete their plans of world destruction.

Using the cybernetic enhancements of her Power Suit, Samus can use a range of weapons and defenses to destroy the enemy. She can also absorb enemies powers into her Power Suit to increase her defense and chance of survival. Using her weapons and special abilities, she must find her way to the central chamber of Tourian and destroy the Mother Brain, the mysterious leader behind the Space Pirates.</desc>

United States, France, England, West Germany, Hungary, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Japan, and Australia. Each track can be played either in single player mode or in head-to-head 2-player action on a split screen. There are 4 different cars to choose from and manual shifting is a consideration during racing, a facet often overlooked in simpler NES racing game scenarios. While the star of the game is Michael Andretti, who pops in before each race to offer useful advice about the current track, the game also has appearances by many other F-1 racing stars.

In order to reach your goal (and find out which of Mickey's friends is in trouble), you'll need to jump and climb your way through various levels which take place in different locations (including a fun house, a treacherous sea side, a pirate ship, and a castle). Each screen has numerous obstacles and enemies which will drain your energy if you come in contact; lose all of your energy, and a life is lost and the game ends when you have no lives left. You control Mickey Mouse and Minnie follows along. You'll need to make sure Minnie stays safe as you make your way through the levels (for example, if you mistime a jump and Mickey lands safely but Minnie doesn't a life will be lost). In addition to avoiding obstacles, there is also some occasional puzzle solving (such as locating a key to open locked doors, or finding your way out of the woods).</desc>

Playing as Mickey you are tasked with collecting at least one of a specific number mold per level you are playing. There are five different locales which are Number City, Number Factory, Space Center, Number Museum, and Pete's Hideout. After a level is completed a basic math problem must be solved for the player to continue. The game contains three difficulty levels with only the super advanced mode allowing you to take damage from enemies.</desc>

	<name>Mickey's Safari in Letterland [USA]</name>
	<desc>Mickey's Safari In Letterland chronicles Mickey Mouse's globetrotting adventures (on a slightly modified globe) to capture letters for educational purposes. Goofy assists with chauffeur and data processing duties. Mickey can venture into any of the following 6 territories: Yukon, Swamp, Forest, Jungle, Pyramid, and Caribbean. In each area, his mission is to collect three diamonds that contain letters. Doing so will spell a word. Then, Mickey ventures to the end of the level and collects a large slab. If Mickey collects the three diamonds in the stage to spell a 3-letter word, Mickey spells the word with digitized audio samples and says the word, complete with an illustration. Then, the slab that Mickey collected at the end of the stage is fed by Goofy through a large machine that spits out a letter. It is up to the player to identify which letter this is.

This game is oriented towards very young children. As such, it is essentially impossible to fail. There are many enemies in the game but none actually inflict harm. Snakes, porcupines, hippos, alligators, and even baby seals-- Mickey just bounces off each. Mickey can also swim handily and sustain long falls.

Further, the game allows the player to point at letters on a board and have Mickey say them using the cartridge's library of digitized mouse voice samples.</desc>

You view the game slightly behind your plane, which must shoot out enemy planes, tanks and installations while avoiding their fire. You are armed with different kinds of weapons including downward bombs, air-to-air missiles and a nuclear bomb. More of each of these can be picked up by collecting the parachutes which are dropped into your path. There are mountain ranges, deserts and arctic scenes to clear along the way, with big boss planes to face.</desc>

	<name>Might &amp; Magic: Secret of the Inner Sanctum [USA]</name>
	<desc>In Might and Magic, the player controls a party of adventurers in a medieval world called Varn. Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Your task is to find the real king and ultimately to stop the alien invasion into Varn.

This is the first game in the  Might and Magic series, and one of the prototypes of role-playing games in general. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. The player creates a party of six adventurers, with traditional classes to choose from (fighter, cleric, etc.). The player also specifies the gender and the age of the characters - they grow old and will eventually die of natural causes. As in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world, performing quests, and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The turn-based battles typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain.

Once again you play as the bomb-hungry caped superhero. Collect the bombs for points and avoid being touched by the different monsters that spawn from crates and the like.

The game now features new scenarios like clouds and forests, as well as the usual sphinx and pyramids backgrounds of the original title.

	<name>Mighty Final Fight [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Capcom's only 8-bit port of the Final Fight series, Mighty Final Fight follows the storyline and characters of the first Final Fight game. Mayor of Metro City Mike Haggar, his ninja friend Guy and his daughter's boyfriend, Cody learn that Haggar's daughter, Jessica,  has been kidnapped by the Mad Gear Gang whose leader has fallen in love with her, and also wants the meddling Mike Haggar to leave town. Now it's personal! Choosing one of the three fighters, the player embarks on a beat-em-up quest through the streets of Metro City.

The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up and a one-player only game (unlike other Final Fight ports). Also exclusive to this particular Final Fight game is the experience system which allows gaining levels to learn additional moves, similar to the first Double Dragon game. The characters have all been squished down to super-deformed 8-bit likenesses.  Graphically this looks similar to River City Ransom. Each character has a button for attack and a button for jumping. Pressing the two together unleashes a character-specific super-move. Various grabbing moves and throws can also be done by moving the player near an enemy.</desc>

	<desc>Mark Tyler, the world's most famous boxer, boasts that he is absolutely invincible and that he can defeat any contender in the world. Nay, the universe! Well as luck would have it a race of alien fighters heard of Mark's claims and have decided to abduct him and pit him against the fiercest boxers in the galaxy.

Power Punch 2 is a one-on-one boxing game à la Punch Out, in which you control Mark as he battles all of the alien contenders in hopes of getting the galactic boxing belt. The game is played from a 3rd person perspective from which you see both fighters as they fight. You have rudimentary movement controls but the basic mechanics involve dodging and timing your attacks so that you can break the enemies patterns. Between fights you get to train in a gym, which involve taking part in a series of mini-games with the rewards being upgraded strength, speed or health for you upcoming bout.</desc>

The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen. When all millipede segments have been destroyed, the player will progress to the next, more difficult level. Millipedes and other creatures are all worth a different amount of points. Occasionally dynamite will appear on the screen, which will explode if shot by the bug zapper. With a well timed shot, numerous millipede segments (and other insects as well) can be taken out as they pass by.</desc>

	<name>Mini Putt [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Mini Putt is a miniature golf game that offers 4 courses, Deluxe, Classic, Traditional and Challenge. Up to 4 players can either play a game or practice any hole on any course. Each course offers its own difficulty level. Deluxe and Challenge have difficult hills and course layouts. The Challenge being the more difficult course. The Classic offers animated bridges and other obstacles. The traditional is your standard miniature golf course which requires well placed bank shots.

To make a shot, using the joystick, move the crosshair in the approximate direction and distance where you wish the ball to go. When you are ready to shoot, hit the fire button. You will notice the level rise in the power bar. When the bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire button again. When you release the fire button, the bar starts to move back down. The mark where you stopped the bar moving indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the bar reaches the bottom of the power bar, it moves horizontally on the accuracy bar. In the middle of the accuracy bar is the center line. Too much to the left of center, it pulls to the left. Too much to the right of center, it pulls to the right. Press the fire button at the right moment to hit the ball. If the course proves to be too tough, visit the Practice course option. Not all of us can be a pro.</desc>

	<name>Mitsume ga Tooru [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Mitsume ga Tooru (translates to The Three-Eyed One) is based on the manga and anime of the same name. You control Hosuke Sharaku - a boy with a third eye on his forehead and of terrifying power. This power is unleashed when his third eye is open so he is wearing a bandage to seal his power and remove any memories of his true nature.

In the game, another three-eyed man with great powers appears and attacks a city. He also kidnaps Sharakus friend Wato who watches unable to do anything. Sharaku then, with the bandage removed, begins his quest to save Wato from this man.

The character you control can fire shots of energy from his forehead eye to attack the enemies that inhabit the 5 stages of the game. He can also summon the Red Condor  a harpoon that can be used for attacking or reaching higher places. Along the way you will find places where you can buy extra lives, different weapons and an improved version of the Red Condor. Money can be gained from defeating enemies or by shooting invisible chickens that can be found in certain levels. You can also increase the value of a coin that is left behind by an enemy if you shoot it multiple times.</desc>

	<desc>Bases Loaded 4 was Jaleco's last 8-bit entry in the long-running baseball series. The game featured slightly more elaborate animations than its predecessor, and much larger fielders. Removed was the goal to play a flawless game; instead the game featured more traditional modes, including exhibition games and full season play.

Geared more toward faced-paced arcade gameplay than simulation, Bases Loaded 4 was not licensed by Major League Baseball or the Major League Baseball Players' Association. Therefore, it did not feature real American (or Japanese, for that matter) teams or players.</desc>

Changes over the previous title included slightly more detailed fielders, a new field perspective (home plate at the top of the screen, center field at the bottom), an editable team, and a new goal: to play the perfect game of baseball against the computer. Simply winning the game was no longer enough; the gamer now had to avoid common baseball missteps such as making an error and striking out, in order to earn a perfect rating. Against the very clever computer pitching, this could prove quite difficult.</desc>

In this vertical and horizontal scrolling shooter, blast away unusual creatures and even more bizarre bosses, while collecting power-ups and super weapons. By repeatedly shooting bells that come out of the clouds, these bells will change colors, each color giving a different ability. Getting shot down releases a ghost of Stinger, which can be recollected to gain the jet's powers back.

In the two-player mode, if TwinBee (cyan craft) and GwinBee (green craft) align their flights (one behind the other) they can turn their guns into a ripple laser. The Japanese version features a three players mode, with the addition of WinBee (the magenta craft, which was removed from the US version).</desc>

	<desc>In this version of Bases Loaded you coach your team through a 130-game season in either an Eastern or western division of a professional baseball league. Win the pennant and you're off to the World Series! You can also play head-to-head with a friend.

Choose from six teams in each division. Once you take your place in the dugout you're the manager, juggling your own lineup and battling order. You'll also have to somewhat of a psychologists as you learn to interpret the Player Performance Ratings. This unique feature of Bases Loaded II rates each player in three categories: physical, sensitivity, and intellectual. Each rating is like a biorhythm, going up and down, just like in real life. The Player Performance Ratings simulate what players really go through - streaks and slumps.
Bases Loaded II also features similar realistic on-field action that was present in the first game of the series.</desc>

	<name>Momotarou Densetsu [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The legend of Momotarou belongs to the most popular ones in Japanese and Asian folklore. The game follows the main story. An old couple, who was living peacefully in a small house, found a giant peach flowing down the river. As they wanted to eat the peach, they found inside a child. They named him "Momotarou" -"peach guy". When Momotarou grew up, he decided to rid the country of the evil demons. He must find three faithful companions - a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, who will help him to defeat the demons. 

This is a traditional Japanese RPG. You move Momotarou over the world map, visiting towns and dungeons. Defeated monsters bring experience points and raise Momotarou's level. Enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based and is viewed from first person perspective.

	<name>Momotarou Densetsu Gaiden [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The game is based on famous Japanese folk tales. Momotarou is a boy who was found in a huge peach (hence his name, "peach guy"). When he grows up, he goes to the island of demons, fights them, takes their treasure, and restores peace in its village. In this game, you don't play directly the story of Momotarou, but control three other popular characters from Japanese folklore, playing three separate stories: as Yashahime, the daughter of the Hell King Emma; Binbougami, or "poverty god", who is hated by people because he takes money from them; and Urashima, the legendary fisherman who once saved a turtle and became friends with the dragon clan. Although the original stories have nothing or little to do with each other or the story of Momotarou, the game ties the stories together by featuring Momotarou as a character in every one of them.

Despite being primarily a game for kids (the story is told in a fairy-tale fashion), this is a full-fledged console-style RPG with levels, party management, world map traveling, dungeons, towns, weapons and armors, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies, viewed from first person perspective.

Warlock didn't let his size impairment get in the way of world domination, however, so it's up to The Vampire and The Monster to stop him! Along the way, both characters will have to fight through Warlock's henchmonsters through the streets, sewers, a construction area and even a Japanese garden.

The game features classic platforming action. The player only has one all-purpose attack and they can also double jump to avoid enemies or reach high ledges. The player can also pick up small objects and use them to attack several enemies at once. If there's only one player, they can choose between The Vampire or The Monster. Or if they don't want to go alone, a friend can join in and help them beat Warlock in the two player co-op mode.

The game is based on the Monster In My Pocket toy franchise. The package also included a limited edition Monster in My Pocket toy, Blemmyea (#81), which was only available with this game.</desc>

	<desc>Take the wheel of a monster truck through nine different events at a time or choose the rally and go through all of them. The nine events are hill climb, drag race, bog, car crush, tug-o-war, sled pull, draw bridge, donuts and the combo course.

In the hill climb, players race on a track comprised mainly of steep hills. The drag race event offers drag racing down a long straight way. The bog event is a race on a track with numerous watery bogs throughout its path. In the car crush event, the player races up and down straight roadways, driving over rows of cars that are lined up for the monster truck to crush. In the tug-o-war competition, the player's truck and the one of the opponent are tied together, facing opposite directions, and the player has to tug the other across the line that is on your own side behind hum. The sled pull has the player drive along a straight path while pulling a weighted sled. While progressing, more weight is added, slowing the truck down. The draw bridge course features drawbridges that go up and down. If the bridge is down, the truck can pass, if it is up, the player has to wait until it comes back down to continue. Donut features races around a small donut-shaped track against an opponent. The combo course event involves all the previous events thrown in throughout a race,

Players can also create your own track or have the game create one at random.</desc>

	<name>Mother [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In the early 1990s, a mysterious dark shadow covered a small country town in rural America. A young married couple vanished from their house without a trace. The man's name was George, the woman's name was Maria. Two years passed, and George suddenly returned. He never spoke to anyone about what he had experienced. Instead, he lead a solitary life and began an odd study, all by himself. His wife never returned.

Eighty years have passed since then. You play the role of a young boy who lives in a small town together with his parents and his two sisters. One day, something strange happens: the house seems to be possessed by a poltergeist. Things start attacking house inhabitants. The boy's father advises him to talk to his grandfather and to learn how to use psychic powers in order to discover the reason behind the strange poltergeist. On his journey, the boy meets three other children: a quiet girl who lives together with her mother, a young genius who isn't accepted by his classmates, and a boy who joined a gang, hoping for revenge. The four heroes will explore the world and find out the connection between the strange events of today and the mystery of the past.

Closely related to the SNES game  EarthBound, "Mother" is an unusual console-style RPG set in modern times. Combat system is similar to Dragon Warrior: you meet random enemies and bosses, and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Instead of magic, your characters can use special psychic powers called PSI.</desc>

	<desc>A simple, top-down driving game where you play a patrol officer in a city police force. You progressively take down bigger bad guys by chasing them down and shooting at them. The gameplay is a precursor to the first Grand Theft Auto games, developed later.

Gameplay consists of driving your squad car around the city, pulling over speeders, by flashing the siren, and stopping random robberies, by shooting the getaway car.  Larger crimes will pop up, which lead to capturing whoever the current Public Enemy No. 1 is.  The game ends when you fail in a mission, or when you total your police cruiser.</desc>

On Madara's 15th birthday, when most of the world had already fallen to the Moki controlled by the Emperor Miroku, Madara sets out to find his real body and save the world from the Moki.

Mouryou Senki Madara is an RPG in which players control a party consisting of up two four characters exploring towns, dungeons and a world map from a top-down perspective. Battles occur randomly and the characters move and fight autonomously, although it is possible to pause battles at any time and order characters to fight, defend, use magic or items or flee. Furthermore, a basic battle strategy (attack, defend, stop or flee) can be selected from a tactics menu, where it is also possible to change the characters' starting formation.</desc>

	<desc>Mr. Gimmick is a little doll with a life of its own, that's given to a girl for her birthday. The girl's other toys quickly become jealous of the attention given to Mr. Gimmick, and they decide to carry her away to a mystical land. Mr. Gimmick goes after them to bring his owner back. 

The game Mr. Gimmick is a platform game where you take control of Mr. Gimmick over the course of six levels. You defend yourself by throwing bouncing stars that take a second to form and are then thrown downward. You can also ride the stars thrown to gain access to higher platforms. The inventory you have allows you to store bombs, potions, and fireballs.

The game has two endings. The easier way is to just run through all of the levels. Each level has a treasure hidden that can be a bit difficult to get, and finding all of these gives access to an extra level. But if you lose all of your lives and have to continue, the game will take all of your treasures away, and not allow you to get to the final level.

	<desc>The conversions of Ms. Pac-Man which were developed by Tengen contained the original game as well as many upgrades, such as the choice between original, small, large or strange mazes, optional or obligatory use of speed booster, alternating or simultaneous 2 player games, difficult selection, and the option to continue a limited number of times. Any maze that is too large to fit on the screen scrolls vertically. Unlike the arcade version, each variation ends after round 32. There is also a fourth intermission called "The End", where Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man wave goodbye to the player, and the game ends. Finally, although there is an "arcade" mode on the NES/Sega Master System versions, the third maze has extra pellets on both the left and right sides of it, which are not present in the original arcade version. The Genesis/SNES versions of the game do not have these pellets, and are arcade accurate as a result.</desc>

	<name>Ms. Pac-Man [USA]</name>
	<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

	<desc>Chaos at the Carnival is a collection of six arcade mini-games.

Miss Piggy has been "pignapped" by the sinister Dr. Grump; her Muppet friends come to the rescue. Kermit, Gonzo, Fozzie and three other characters from the children's TV show dash into Grump's mysterious fun fair in search for their pink companion. They must brave five rides in succession in order to take on the Grumpasaurus in the final carnival confrontation.

1. Tunnel of Love: Avoid objects in the waterway
2. Duck Hunt: Hit passing ducks with tomatoes
3. Space Ride: Land a spaceship in the correct dock using rocket blasts
4. Bumper Cars: Race around the track and avoid crashing into obstacles
5. Funhouse: Find a way through a small maze filled with guard dogs
6. Battle of the Grumpasaurus: Tickle the Grumpasaurus so that he laughs himself silly

The C-64, Apple II and DOS versions of Chaos at the Carnival support two players, taking turns.

The versions for the four platforms differ strongly; see the trivia section for details.

One day he hears of a rumor that the evil wizard Kojiro, his father's archenemy, has apparently reared up his ugly head once again! Kojiro's demons invade the land, and threaten death and destruction. "I shall defeat Kojiro!" - says Musashi, - "and maybe even get laid"...

Musashi no Boken can be described as Dragon Warrior set in feudal Japan, as apart from the distinct classical Japanese flavor demonstrated here, the games are very similar. Musashi travels over the world map, visits towns, buys weapons and armor, descends into dungeons, and fights enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a first-person perspective.

	<desc>Michael Andretti's World GP features 16 unique courses located in Brazil, San Marino, Monaco, Mexico, Canada, 
United States, France, England, West Germany, Hungary, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Japan, and Australia. Each track can be played either in single player mode or in head-to-head 2-player action on a split screen. There are 4 different cars to choose from and manual shifting is a consideration during racing, a facet often overlooked in simpler NES racing game scenarios. While the star of the game is Michael Andretti, who pops in before each race to offer useful advice about the current track, the game also has appearances by many other F-1 racing stars.

	<name>NARC [USA]</name>
	<desc>Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.

Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.

More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?</desc>

	<desc>Its another day at school in Nekketsu High and series star Kunio finds a note in his locker challenging him to a secret martial arts tournament. Sure enough Kunio and his friend Riki accept the challenge and head out with the hopes of becoming the grand champions of the city.

Kakuto Densetsu is another 2d side scrolling beat'em up in Nekketsu High series, featuring the same gameplay which involves beating up your enemies in side scrolling levels with a combination of punches, kicks and special moves. The differences in this title however, are that the entire game is laid out as 2-on-2 tournament fights in non-scrolling arenas in which your team must come up on the winning end and advance to the next round. You can play with good old Kunio or create your own character and advance his stats as he goes along in standard Nekketsu High fashion, and you can play alone with an AI-controlled partner or with a friend (you can also go for a 4-player battle royale in the Vs mode). 

Backgrounds have a major role in the fights, with several hazard zones and unique features, and the game also encourages teamwork as many special moves can be unlocked only by combining both of your characters (depending on their compatibility)

The game is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.</desc>

	<name>Nekketsu Koukou Dodgeball-bu : Soccer Hen [Japan]</name>
	<desc>This soccer game was made at the time when Nintendo introduced their four player adapter, and was probably made for the four playing purpose. This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability.

When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.

In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.</desc>

	<desc>This ain't elementary school and it sure as heck ain't gym class. This is Super Dodge Ball. Control your team of six players to pummel the opposing team into submission using only the ball and your team's unique skills. Each player has his own special attacks and each team has their own unique attributes.

Play the World Cup mode and take on teams from around the world to claim the championship. You play as the star USA team and must work your way through teams from countries such as England, Iceland, Japan, and more to finally take on the current ruling world champions, the Soviet Union.

Or you can challenge a friend in Versus mode and go head to head with whatever teams you choose.

Or, if you just feel like cutting loose, you can play Bean Ball mode which is just a free-for-all every-man-for-himself romp in the school yard. Be the last man standing. You can play this alone or with a friend, but the computer will control the remaining 4-5 players.</desc>

	<desc>Another action/sports title in the Nekketsu High game series. Nekketsu Street Basket is exactly what it sounds like: a tournament of two-on-two "street" basketball matches all across the US featuring the characters of the Nekketsu High series.

The game uses the same base engine and graphics as the other games in the series, featuring super-deformed sprites moving across a side-scrolling stage trying to defeat the opposing team. You can pass the ball, shoot it, and attempt super dunks for added points. As with other Nekketsu games you can choose to play foul and beat the hell out of your opponents with your bare hands or any weapon you can find in the stages, and there are many other rule-bending features such as double and triple hoops that score extra points.</desc>

	<desc>In NES Open Tournament Golf, you can play a round of golf on one of three different courses. One or two players can play in the U.S., Japan, or the U.K. and choose a stroke or match play game. Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook. If you are unable to finish a round in one play, NES Open Tournament Golf features a battery back-up allowing you to save the game and continue later.</desc>

	<desc>Nintendo takes its game to the gridiron with NES Play Action Football.  While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season.  You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.

Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen.  Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run.  The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from.  The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.

Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains.  Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play.  Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!</desc>

	<desc>New Ghostbusters II follows loosely the original Ivan Reitman's film plot. You start out by selecting two ghostbusters out of  five (The 5th one is Louis Tully). The first, player controlled buster will use proton pack and second, controlled by AI, uses the trap where ghosts end up, after been freezed by using the proton pack. Player controlled buster can get hurt, if touched by a ghost, while AI buster can't. 

The game's perspective is Top-Down, where you move from a one room to another and get rid of ghosts. The type of ghosts vary. After every level you have to fight against a boss, usually someone from the movie. For example, in the first courthouse level you fight against the Scoleri brothers. 

The game contains six levels, inspired by the movie:The Courthouse

	<desc>Willy is a young jazz cat who goes by the name of "The Rockin' Kat". His girlfriend, Jill, was kidnapped by Mugsy, the local crime boss.

In this side scrolling game, you must help Rockin' Kat Willy to save his girlfriend through 7 stages. Each stage is a TV show broadcast through different channels of a TV set, and you must thus choose which channel you want to play. Through the channels Willy it will be sent to different themed shows such as western movies, gangster movies, etc, as well as some bonus channels.

Willy can walk and jump around, and carries as a weapon a spring-load Super Punch Gun, which he can put in diverse uses:

1. Knock his enemies: by pressing A.
Perform higher jumps: by jumping (B) and pressing down + A.
Spin Attack: by grabbing a ledge (A) and rotating with the d-pad.
Spin Jump: by grabbing a ledge (A), rotating with the d-pad and jumping (B).
Catch and Trow: by holding A, grabbing an object and releasing A.

He can also buy attachments that will make his gun more powerful, such as the Bomber, the Twin Balls, the Hammer Punch and the Jet Sneakers. 

Rockin' Kats is so cartoonish that you might expect to see it on Saturday morning TV.</desc>

	<name>The New Zealand Story [Europe]</name>
	<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

	<desc>Based on professional football as played in the National Football League, NFL was the first 8-bit console game to carry the official NFL license. There is no NFLPA license, though, which means the 28 real teams are included, but no player names or faces.

The player is in control of the action from a side-scrolling perspective. The camera also zooms in for closeups on receiving plays. However, NFL is also a very strategic, coaching-oriented take on the sport, featuring large playbooks (team plays are included on a separate fold-out sheet bundled with the game manual, but not onscreen in the game itself), limited customization of team skills, and penalties.</desc>

	<name>A Nightmare on Elm Street [USA]</name>
	<desc>LJN's NES version of the classic horror series casts the player as a teen searching the houses on Elm Street for Freddy Krueger's bones. Once they are all collected, they must be thrown into the high school  furnace to destroy Freddy once and for all (a plot similar to 1987's A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors).

Nightmare has two worlds. In the red-tinted "real world," players fight snakes and spiders while navigating standard platform challenges. The players here have a "sleep meter" that depletes with every hit taken. If the player's sleep meter drops to empty, the game transitions into the blue-tinted "dream world," where enemies take on the appearance of skeletons and ghosts. An invisible timer also starts, counting down until Freddy appears and forces the player into a brief boss battle. The sleep meter becomes a standard life gauge in the dream world, and deducts a life from the player if drained.

Players can find and collect three different icons in the dream world to become "Dream Warriors" with special powers and projectile attacks - both of which give a significant edge when fighting Freddy. Collecting all the bones in a level takes the player to a final level boss, usually taking the form of a monster with Freddy's face or trademark razor glove. Players move back and forth down Elm Street, and a new house opens up as the previous one is cleared.

Nightmare is compatible with the NES Four Score accessory, allowing up to four players to play at once using the same screen.</desc>

	<desc>The game is set in the Middle Ages, all around the famous silkroad, that connected China and the Middle East. In the fictional kingdom Littleland, the evil Zrool conspired against the royal family. He killed the king and the queen and usurped the throne, initiating a dark era of tyranny. But one of the king's guards, Radley, took the young heir of the throne and brought him securely to Damascus, where he grows up. Realizing he is the true prince of the Littleland dynasty, the young hero follows Radley's instructions and sets on a quest to find seven magical rainbow pieces, which alone will be able to destroy Zrool.

The game is a console-style RPG with first-person perspective, turn-based combat, and some interesting gameplay elements. You get neither experience points nor money from random enemies. Instead, by fighting a lot your popularity increases, and you are able to trade items by buying them in one town and selling in another. Trading is the only effective way of getting money in the game. You become stronger by buying and equipping better weapons and armor. Also, there is a thirst factor in the game. You have to drink water regularly, or else you'll be dried to death.</desc>

Ninja Crusaders is a side-scrolling action game that can be played alone or with 2 players fighting side by side. A ninja player can jump quite high and begins the game with a ninja throwing star weapon that can travel the length of the screen, although it's not very powerful. Other weapons are available for the taking throughout the levels, each with considerably less range than the stars but with more power. These weapons include a chain whip, a sword, and a bo staff. Battle your way past vistas of a post-apocalyptic world but try not to get hit because one enemy strike will take care of your ninja.</desc>

	<desc>In Ninja Crusaders, a force of alien invaders has descended upon the earth and has wiped out humanity for the most part. Some ninjas survived the onslaught, however, and 2 ninjas in particular named Blade and Talon are assigned to rid the earth of this alien menace.

Ninja Crusaders is a side-scrolling action game that can be played alone or with 2 players fighting side by side. A ninja player can jump quite high and begins the game with a ninja throwing star weapon that can travel the length of the screen, although it's not very powerful. Other weapons are available for the taking throughout the levels, each with considerably less range than the stars but with more power. These weapons include a chain whip, a sword, and a bo staff. Battle your way past vistas of a post-apocalyptic world but try not to get hit because one enemy strike will take care of your ninja.</desc>

	<name>Ninja Gaiden [USA] (Beta)</name>
	<desc>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which 2 ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</desc>

	<name>Ninja Gaiden III : The Ancient Ship of Doom [USA]</name>
	<desc>This is the third entry in the series of fast-paced ninja action games, and is the last game in the series to be released on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Some time has passed since the defeat of Ashtar and the resurrected Jaquio, and Irene Lew has received a new mission to complete. She is to observe a strange factory that has been constructed recently for an unknown purpose, and investigate it. She proceeds to reconnoiter it, but is intercepted and apparently assassinated by her friend Ryu Hayabusa...except it isn't Ryu. It is an imposter. The real Ryu, angered over her death, and the subsequent false accusation that he murdered her, continues her mission and proceeds to investigate the factory.

As stated, this was the last game in the regular series produced for the NES. It had many features the previous games in the series did not, such as a power up to extend the length of your sword, a new vertical "wave" attack and vertically-scrolling levels. The US version of the game is reputed to be the hardest in the series, due to the extra damage incurred when hit, slightly shorter regular sword length, limited continues and more enemies.

The Lynx port is the second Ninja Gaiden game on the platform, the first being a port from the Arcade Version. This port is identical to the NES game, but the in-game picture is compressed for the smaller screen of the Lynx.

	<desc>The game opens on a vegetative theme: siblings Maru and Cori are sent to bed early for not eating their vegetables, whereupon they drift off to sleep and dream together. Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! "Lettuce check it out," urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. "I yam King Kale," he says, "Won't you peas peas help me?" Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.

It seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and "vegetable-themed" guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.

Our two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.</desc>

	<name>Ninja Jajamaru Kun [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. 

Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.

In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.

As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.

Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.

The items in this game are:

1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.

2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!

3. Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.

4. Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.

5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.
2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!

6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.

7. Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.</desc>

	<name>Ninja Kid [USA]</name>
	<desc>Ninja Kid is a side-scrolling action game in which the eponymous kid must jump and shoot his way through a series of different levels in order to complete his quest. The assorted levels include the Poison Field, Guerrila Warfare, and Blazing Inferno. While armed with ninja bullets by default, he occasionally has the opportunity to pick up other offensive items such as ninja stars, boomerangs, or fireballs. Enemies obstructing Ninja Kid's quest include rolling eyeballs, crows, flying demons, Frankenstein monsters, and of course, other ninjas.

The game begins in an overhead map that allows the player to wander into various side-scrolling levels. The levels go on an on until the player completes a particular task that makes a door appear. Going through the door sometimes leads outside to the overhead map and sometimes leads to a boss battle.

In Japan, this game was known as Gegege no Kitaro: Yokaidaimakyo, based on an animated TV series.</desc>

It is the spritual successor to UPL's original Ninjakun. It was released around the world with the title Ninja-Kid II, and in the United States with the title Rad Action.

Ashura no Shou expands upon the basic gameplay introduced in Ninjakun, by introducing new exploration concepts and challenging the player to complete 31 stages of action, with branching levels, larger enemies, and boss battles. The game was ported to the MSX and published by HAL Laboratory. It was also ported to the Famicom in 1988. A US release for the NES was planned under the name Ninja Taro, but ultimately cancelled. The Famicom port was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan in 2009.</desc>

	<name>Nintendo World Championships 1990 [USA]</name>
	<desc>This is the cartridge that was used for the Nintendo World Championships held in 1990 in 30 cities across the U.S. and Canada. The player has a total of 6-7 minutes to play all three games but this can be changed by DIP switches on the cartridge.

The first game played is a version of Super Mario Bros. in which the player is given 99 lives and the goal of collecting 50 coins in the first level. Upon collecting the 50th coin, the "finished the castle" music will play and a score will be displayed.

The second game played is Course 1 of Rad Racer, using the 328 Twin Turbo vehicle. The player must finish the course as quickly as possible. No clock is shown in the game but the cartridge keeps track internally. After finishing Rad Racer, its score is displayed, multiplied by 10 and added to the previous Super Mario Bros. score.

Last up is Nintendo's Tetris in A-type mode. All remaining time for the Championship is played out here. The player's objective is simply to get the best score. The Tetris score is multiplied by 25 and added to the previous Super Mario Bros. and Rad Racer scores.

After all the time runs out, a screen will display "Time!" and display the final score, a sum of the previous scores and their multipliers.</desc>

In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot.

However unhappy people from around the world have captured different animal species, preventing Noah from doing his job. Noah will need to visit these different locations and free the animals from the people holding them captive.

Noah's Ark is a side scrolling action game. The player, as Noah, must choose which level from several world locations to play. Once in a level, Noah can move left right, duck, jump and fire pellets directly in front of him. These pellets can be used to defeat enemy creatures and uncover hidden items. At the end of each level, Noah will encounter a stronger enemy creature who must be defeated. Noah's ultimate goal is to rescue the designated captive animals listed for each level.</desc>

	<name>Nobunaga no Yabou - Sengoku Gunyuu Den [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.

The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment. 

There are two scenarios available in the game: 

1. Warlords: 1560 A.D.
The first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will eventually become a full scale war in the whole of Japan. The warring states period begins here. There are 28 of them included in the scenario, among others: the Mori clan, the Takeda, the Hojo clan, the Uesugi clan, etc.

Nobunaga's Ambition: 1582 A.D.
The second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D. to power and allows the player to play either as Oda Nobunaga or as one of his chief allies or rivals. 

Samurai
The game improves on its predecessor by including some 400 historical samurai in the game, providing the player with generals for troops and governors for a conquered fief. 

Each samurai is characterized by statistics: Age, Rank, Body Points, War, Politics, Ambition, Charisma, and Loyalty. There are also additional attributes for specific military purposes: Skill, Arms Level, and Unit Type. Some of these attributes may be improved through training (i.e. war, politics, and skill), rewards (i.e. loyalty), or through merchants (i.e. arms level). 

Strategy
The game is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. Certain events take place annually such as tax collecting (March) and rice harvest (September), while other events, such as invading neighbors, follows the player's time table.

The game uses an initiative system to determine what actions can be completed in a particular month. Each daimyo and samurai has a stock of "Body Points" that represent the attention he can afford to spend on an action. Each action has a cost in Body Points for the character executing it, and if he does not have the points necessary, he may not perform it. Body Points are refreshed a little each month. The level of Body Points refreshed per month is depends on the level of his Political skill. Intensive operations will deplete Body Points and then require turns of inaction to stock up again, so timing actions to coincide with Body Point availability is an extra wrinkle to the management of resources.

Combat
Each samurai can lead a 100-strong unit, which must be recruited, then trained, and equipped with weapons for battle. The attack of an army results in a tactical play out of the resulting battle or siege. A hex-based map of the area of the battlefield will form the playing board for the movement to combat and actual fighting. Fortifications (castles) have a dramatic benefit for the defender. The attacker must defeat the defender within 30 days or must force a withdrawal. Additionally, both sides must pay attention to their food provisions as each day subtracts food supplies in accordance to their army size.

Unit Types
The game introduces 3 basic military unit types: Infantry (Inf), Cavalry (Cav), and Rifles (Rif). Each unit type has certain special abilities and tactical advantages/disadvantages in combat:

1. Infantry have the ability to ambush anywhere on the main fief map (explained later) and have 4 movement points; 
Cavalry have the ability to charge at an enemy (inflicting considerable damage on both sides) with the chance of breaking through the defending unit and emerging on the other side. Samurai leaders may often be killed (instead of captured) if their unit reaches zero. Cavalry have 6 movement points; Rifles may attack using muskets which have devastating offensive capabilities, which may also kill an enemy samurai unit if the opponent's unit reaches zero (thus, a standard non-rifle attack is also available for capturing an enemy samurai leader). Rifles have 3 movement points.

 
Additionally, both Infantry and Rifle units may move over walls or through water during the castle siege for a certain amount of movement points.

Tactical Combat
Tactical combat occurs in two different locations:

The first is the tactical map of the fief, where the attackers first arrive and the defenders surrounding the castle. In this setting, each days is divided into three time periods: morning, afternoon, and night, before the day ends. At night, armies may maneuver to surprise attack enemies in the dark, which does considerably more damage than an average attack. This may be done if the enemy is at least two squares away (not adjacent).

The second is the castle siege map, which occurs if the defender chooses to retreat to the castle from the previous map. Here, each turn represents one day, thus the time limit of the attack as well as the provisions of both sides, rapidly decrease with each turn. In this setting, the siege force must break down gates leading towards the castle for the final engagement. The defender is defeated, if the governor of the fief retreats, or if his unit is destroyed: resulting either in his capture or death.

The end outcome is either the fall of the fief to the attacking forces or victory for the defenders. Either way, captured samurai (if any) will require a prompt response for release, beheading, or recruitment to the winner's force.</desc>

Each samurai can lead a 100-strong unit, which must be recruited, then trained, and equipped with weapons for battle. The attack of an army results in a tactical play out of the resulting battle or siege. A hex-based map of the area of the battlefield will form the playing board for the movement to combat and actual fighting. Fortifications (castles) have a dramatic benefit for the defender. The attacker must defeat the defender within 30 days or must force a withdrawal. Additionally, both sides must pay attention to their food provisions as each day subtracts food supplies in accordance to their army size.

Unit Types
The game introduces 3 basic military unit types: Infantry (Inf), Cavalry (Cav), and Rifles (Rif). Each unit type has certain special abilities and tactical advantages/disadvantages in combat:

1. Infantry have the ability to ambush anywhere on the main fief map (explained later) and have 4 movement points; 
Cavalry have the ability to charge at an enemy (inflicting considerable damage on both sides) with the chance of breaking through the defending unit and emerging on the other side. Samurai leaders may often be killed (instead of captured) if their unit reaches zero. Cavalry have 6 movement points; Rifles may attack using muskets which have devastating offensive capabilities, which may also kill an enemy samurai unit if the opponent's unit reaches zero (thus, a standard non-rifle attack is also available for capturing an enemy samurai leader). Rifles have 3 movement points.

 
Additionally, both Infantry and Rifle units may move over walls or through water during the castle siege for a certain amount of movement points.

Tactical Combat
Tactical combat occurs in two different locations:

The first is the tactical map of the fief, where the attackers first arrive and the defenders surrounding the castle. In this setting, each days is divided into three time periods: morning, afternoon, and night, before the day ends. At night, armies may maneuver to surprise attack enemies in the dark, which does considerably more damage than an average attack. This may be done if the enemy is at least two squares away (not adjacent).

The second is the castle siege map, which occurs if the defender chooses to retreat to the castle from the previous map. Here, each turn represents one day, thus the time limit of the attack as well as the provisions of both sides, rapidly decrease with each turn. In this setting, the siege force must break down gates leading towards the castle for the final engagement. The defender is defeated, if the governor of the fief retreats, or if his unit is destroyed: resulting either in his capture or death.

The end outcome is either the fall of the fief to the attacking forces or victory for the defenders. Either way, captured samurai (if any) will require a prompt response for release, beheading, or recruitment to the winner's force.</desc>

	<name>Nobunaga no Yabou - Zenkoku Ban [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. 

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.

During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp;amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.</desc>

	<name>Nobunaga's Ambition II [USA]</name>
	<desc>Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.

The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment. 

There are two scenarios available in the game: 

1. Warlords: 1560 A.D.
The first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will eventually become a full scale war in the whole of Japan. The warring states period begins here. There are 28 of them included in the scenario, among others: the Mori clan, the Takeda, the Hojo clan, the Uesugi clan, etc.

Nobunaga's Ambition: 1582 A.D.
The second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D. to power and allows the player to play either as Oda Nobunaga or as one of his chief allies or rivals. 

Samurai
The game improves on its predecessor by including some 400 historical samurai in the game, providing the player with generals for troops and governors for a conquered fief. 

Each samurai is characterized by statistics: Age, Rank, Body Points, War, Politics, Ambition, Charisma, and Loyalty. There are also additional attributes for specific military purposes: Skill, Arms Level, and Unit Type. Some of these attributes may be improved through training (i.e. war, politics, and skill), rewards (i.e. loyalty), or through merchants (i.e. arms level). 

Strategy
The game is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. Certain events take place annually such as tax collecting (March) and rice harvest (September), while other events, such as invading neighbors, follows the player's time table.

The game uses an initiative system to determine what actions can be completed in a particular month. Each daimyo and samurai has a stock of "Body Points" that represent the attention he can afford to spend on an action. Each action has a cost in Body Points for the character executing it, and if he does not have the points necessary, he may not perform it. Body Points are refreshed a little each month. The level of Body Points refreshed per month is depends on the level of his Political skill. Intensive operations will deplete Body Points and then require turns of inaction to stock up again, so timing actions to coincide with Body Point availability is an extra wrinkle to the management of resources.

Combat
Each samurai can lead a 100-strong unit, which must be recruited, then trained, and equipped with weapons for battle. The attack of an army results in a tactical play out of the resulting battle or siege. A hex-based map of the area of the battlefield will form the playing board for the movement to combat and actual fighting. Fortifications (castles) have a dramatic benefit for the defender. The attacker must defeat the defender within 30 days or must force a withdrawal. Additionally, both sides must pay attention to their food provisions as each day subtracts food supplies in accordance to their army size.

	<desc>The game is based on a popular animé series for children. The hero Anpanman is the son of the baker Jam-ojisan. His head is made entirely out of bread and bean jam. He rescues starving creatures, to whom he gives parts of his head to eat, and fights the evil Baikinman ("Germ Man") and his minions.

This game contains five mini-games, some of which have educational purposes. The game is controlled entirely by a special mouse-like device which is shipped with it. The mini-games are:

1. Try to catch the apples Anpanman drops from the sky by running around a small field.

2. Combine puzzle pieces together to create images of the animé's characters.

3. Practice to write Japanese syllables (hiragana) with the help of Anpanman.

4. Figure out the differences between similar pictures.

5. Uncover characters' faces by clicking on empty spaces on a board. Uncovering an enemy's face will make you fail (a concept not unlike  Minesweeper).</desc>

	<name>Olympus no Tatakai: Ai no Densetsu [Japan]</name>
	<desc>This game is much like Zelda II: The Adventure of Link turned into ancient Greece. You play as Orpheus, whose girlfriend, Helene, has been kidnapped by the demonic ruler of the netherworld called Hades. So begins the journey.

Just like in Zelda II, there is a top-down map of Greece with towns and other locations to explore. Each of these has side-scrolling sections in which Orpheus fights his way through the minions of Hades. There are various items one must get to continue to the next location, including swords, shields and crystals. There are three fragments of love hidden around; Orpheus has to find them before he can enter Tartarus and fight Hades to save his beloved Helene.

The monsters of the game are also based on the Greek mythology and it is pretty entertaining to confront cyclopes, minotaurs and pegasuses.</desc>

	<desc>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?

Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. 

You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. 

Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

	<name>Orb-3d [USA]</name>
	<desc>The evil space wizard Krohn has mastered the power to control a black hole, and plans on using this power to control the universe. You are an explorer on assignment in a remote corner of the universe. You have just been reassigned to fight Krohn since your ship, the Millennium Orb, is the only space craft cabable of withstanding Krohn's black hole. To defeat Krohn, you must get past 30 different chambers blocking the path. On the left and right side of each chamber are force fields which you must maneuver to keep the Millennium orb within the chamber. Each chamber contains a plane in the center with various targets, around which the Orb will travel. You can make the Orb dive out of it's orbital path into the plane and hit the targets. To complete each chamber you need to complete a goal with the targets (often you will need to figure out a way to clear them all.) The Millenium Orb has a limited amount of feul, however, which will be used up over time and in even greater quantities should you miss the Orb with the force fields. When fuel is low, you can head to Vern's Orb-O-Rama and use earned credits to refuel your Orb. 

Included with the game is a pair of 3-D glasses which can give the game a more 3 dimensional appearance, though they aren't required for gameplay.</desc>

	<name>Outlanders [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Tetsuya Wakatsuki was just an average guy, lazy but well-meaning, and a photographer for the local newspaper. Your planet being attacked by an invading alien armada tends to change that sort of thing, though. The young princess of the invading army, Kahm, comes to Earth to take part in the annihilation of the human race. She ends up stranded on Earth, where Tetsuya finds her, and they fall for each other.

They decide that if they were to get married, the two planets would no longer be able to fight, and so they set off for Kahm's home planet to seek permission from her father, the emperor. Having been the one who ordered the invasion in the first place, though, he is not particularly pleased with this turn of events. Tetsuya is imprisoned, and Kahm is taken away to places unknown. Now, Tetsuya must break out of prison and rescue Kahm!

Outlanders is an action RPG based on the manga by Joji Manabe. Tetsuya, being just a regular guy, isn't a particularly able fighter, and at first is only equipped with a sword, though he can eventually find other weapons including a gun. At the beginning, Tetsuya's only companion is the brown, cloaked alien Nao, who helps him escape the holding cell, but eventually he will find others who will help him. Other standard RPG features are also present: items can be found and stored, and some characters can learn magic. The game uses a password system to save progress.</desc>

	<name>Overlord [USA]</name>
	<desc>Overlord is a real-time strategic warfare game where the player must manage large standing armies, economic capital, and political stability throughout a number of extra-dimensional star systems. 

As the dictatorial ruler of the Epsilon Galaxy, the player has obtained complete, indisputable authority. However, during a scientific experiment in hyperdrive technology, Epsilon scientists discovered four "buffer" dimensions, each containing a number of barren planets that exist between the Epsilon Galaxy and another alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these alternate dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own experiments. The player must battle these alien species for control of these buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the Epsilon Galaxy remains intact.

To make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase terraforming equipment which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque worlds which are ideal for agriculture, mineral-rich and heavily volcanic worlds, desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, or ecologically balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily able to generate significant income through taxation. In addition, the player can mine for resources and tax their citizens to raise money, construct spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and equip them, buy battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The player can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The end goal is to ensure that the other alien races do not gain the upper hand by conquering these four new dimensions before the player can.

The player cannot retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the hyperspace link from their universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the player's homeworld, which is where the hyperspace generator is located. Politically (at the very least), this is not an option.

Blood will have to be shed for supremacy of the hyperspace planets, and for the player to become Overlord of these four new dimensions plus their own.</desc>

To fight back, you can use hand-to-hand, and pick up weapon power-ups, found on the ground, in rooms, or dropped by enemies. These weapons include a knife, which can be used to stab or be thrown, guns and grenades.

	<name>Pac-Land [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Pac-Land is a side-scrolling 1-2 player game with a cartoony feel to it. Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

	<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

	<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

You soon learn that the King of Slumberland has been kidnapped by the Prince of Nightmares, and you are requested to save him by Princess Camille.  Using your only weapon, a sack of candy, you stun enemies and lull friendly animals into helping you through levels like the Mushroom Forest and Train Land.  This platformer featured licensed characters and artwork from the comic, along with using the animals, such as apes and moles, to traverse through the different terrain.

	<desc>The goal of Palamedes is to clear the screen which is, line by line, filling up with dice. Players control a small person situated near the bottom of the screen, who can only be moved to the left or right. The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.

There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</desc>

	<name>Palamedes II : Star Twinkle, Hoshi no Mabataki [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Palamedes II can be described as "its predecessor, turned upside down". As before, your goal is to rearrange a set of dice and put them in a row for elimination. Only series of dice such as 4-4-4-4-4 or 1-2-3-4-5 can be eliminated, and depending on the series, this will result in one or several rows of dice to be eliminated from the screen. Unlike the original Palamedes, this time your character stands on top of the dice, and the growing pile of dice will crush him unless he makes the correct combinations to eliminate the pile. It's a bit like Tetris, and a bit like Klax.

Two modes are available: Mode 1 puts your player on top of a growing pile which must be eliminated. It can be played alone (single), against another human (match) or in a quest against the computer. 

Mode 2 puts your player on an already well-stocked pile, but unlike mode 1, the stacks can't be rearranged in order to reach the desired dice, so you have to make do with what is in the top layer to match whatever dice is shown on top of the playfield. An opposing player does the same, and the first one to reach the bottom wins. If both players run out of matching dice, a countdown begins to reveal a new dice, and it's necessary to react quickly to find the matching one in your pile. Due to the nature of mode 2, it can't be played alone, only in match or quest mode.</desc>

	<name>Panic Restaurant [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Panic Restaurant is a side-scrolling platform game where you play as chef Cookie. The rival chef Ohdove has taken over his restaurant and it's up to Cookie to reclaim it.

It is a fairly basic platform game. You run and jump, and enemies are placed all around to try and stop you. The entire game, backgrounds, enemies and bosses, is food-themed. You encounter things such as sausages, microwave ovens, onions and hamburgers on your way through the restaurant. To your help you always have a frying pan to beat the enemies with, and you can also find other items, such as a spoon, and plates to throw at the enemies.

The game contains 6 stages, each in a separate location in the restaurant, such as the kitchen, freezer and basement. At the end of each level you are faced with a boss. In between each level is a bonus game where you play a slot machine to try and win some extra health and lives.</desc>

	<name>Parallel World [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Having been sucked into and stranded in an alternate universe, you and your girlfriend must work your way around the puzzles of a magnificent castle to make your way back home.

The castle itself consists of a total of twenty worlds consisting of five stages apiece, each of which is filled to the brim with enemies. From your overhead view, you must use your directional pad to move your character around the grid and push the onscreen obstacles into your enemies to destroy them for the keys to escape as well as other goodies (extra time, bonus points, etc.), but keep in mind that you'll need to use those same obstacles to construct a path to the exit. And don't forget to work fast either, as you only have 100 seconds to clear each puzzle. Fail and you'll lose a life (you start with only three).

This game may be played with either one or two players (simultaneous play). Player One controls the boy. Player Two gets to be the girl. Both must have their wits about them to make it past the hoards of springs, crazy rollers, witches, zombies, and more to make it home in one piece.</desc>

	<name>Perfect Bowling [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Perfect Bowling is a Japan-only Famicom bowling game, in which the player competes with other computer opponents. Each of the opponents has their own name, appearance and style of play. The game seems to take place in the future, with lanes restocking pins with lasers and certain characters dressed in strange, futuristic (or at least an 80s interpretation of futuristic) fashions. This is a complete departure from its box art, which seems more reminiscent of the 1950s and 60s.

The game allows for a lot of precision-based options in order to bowl effectively. This includes rotating the ball to put spin on it, selecting the power and hitting the power gauge just right. The player can also select which hand they favor and the weight of the ball during the character creation process.</desc>

	<desc>When Ronnie the Super Rat radiates earth with a pest beam from his moon base, the world leaders' only hope is Kernel Kleanup, the mascot from the Western Exterminator Company. With his trusty hammer, Kernel needs to clear the levels by slamming all loose bugs. You will be haunted by spiders, ants, fireflies, worms, sharks, jellyfish and mutants.

The nine levels are pretty straightforward side-scrolling platform stages, with a nice twist in level 5, 7 and 8.1 (a helicopter, underwater and moon surface level respectively). While playing, you can view a status report with the remaining bugs to be found. Some defeated enemies leave behind hearts (extra lives) and the final level introduces an adventure element when you have to find a key card to open the door to Ronnie's lair.</desc>

	<name>Pictionary: The Game of Video Quick Draw [USA]</name>
	<desc>Based on the board game, the object is to guess either a word or phrase based on a drawing. Each team starts on the same square on the board and the first team attempts to draw a picture based on a clue.  If his team correctly guesses the clue, then this team gets to roll the dice and advance along the board.  If the team fails to guess correctly, then the other team gets a chance to draw and guess. The game plays much in this way until a team reaches the final square on the board and successfully guesses the clue to win the game.

This game contains three different modes; regular game, alternative game, and drawing practice. It also allows for up to four teams which can be made comprising of any number of players per each team. 

In the regular game, a team will be given a turn to start revealing pieces of one of the 500+ drawings that are hidden in the game. Each drawing is a 6x8 size and has 48 pieces to it. To reveal the pieces, the player is made to play one of four timed minigames which are chosen depending on the color of the square the player landed on the board. The minigames consist of Attack of the Paint Zombies, The WareHouse Shuffle, Leapin' Energy Capsules!, and Four Alarm Rescue. In Attack of the Paint Zombies the player fires downwards at the aliens and the more aliens that are hit the more pieces that are revealed of the drawing. If the aliens hit the player, the player loses time off the clock. In The WareHouse Shuffle, the player goes all the way to the left side and then stacks as many boxes on top of each other that they can bring over all the way to the right side. While transporting the boxes, their are two enemies who can hit into your boxes thus subtracting them from the haul and also taking time away. Each box brought over reduces a piece of the hidden drawing. In  Leapin' Energy Capsules!, the player is an astronaut and is moving and jumping to collect blue spheres. While collecting the spheres the player must try to avoid hitting any enemies which will reduce time. Each sphere collected clears up another piece of the drawing. In Four Alarm Rescue, the player controls a pair of firemen on the ground with a net who are moving back and forth catching the jumping people above on the net. Each person rescued leads a revealed piece of the drawing while each person not rescued leads to reduced time.

The alternative game allows the player to draw the picture for other players to guess, so their are no minigames in this mode. Other than that, it is the same as the regular mode.

Drawing practice lets the player practice their drawing technique without the pressure of a timer.</desc>

	<name>Pipe Dream [USA]</name>
	<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

	<desc>A totally radical game entrenched in a deep underground maze of never-ending pipes. Here is your big chance to try out those plumbing skills. The water is on, think ahead, and most of all, keep on your toes. Nasty accidents do happen! The general idea is to keep the water flow happening by adding the most appropriate piece of pipe. Well, it sounds easy enough, but the pace gets pretty hectic as the water stream picks up momentum. You may want to use a cross pipe, straight pipe, points pipe or try connecting a storage tank along the way to slow things down while you try and catch your breath. Don't relax for too long or the only breath you'll be catching is underwater. The minute you thought you were done with this floor, here comes the next floor, just a little faster. Watch out... a totally addictive game!</desc>

	<name>Pirates! [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Take on the life of a buccaneer in the golden age of Caribbean Piracy! This game lets you choose from 6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented. 

The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of "evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.  

The game is educational, as you will learn about piracy through the thoroughly researched manual. You'll smell the sea salt as you participate in wild sword fights, desperate sea battles, and daring attacks by land!

	<desc>Take on the life of a buccaneer in the golden age of Caribbean Piracy! This game lets you choose from 6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented. 

The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of "evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.  

The game is educational, as you will learn about piracy through the thoroughly researched manual. You'll smell the sea salt as you participate in wild sword fights, desperate sea battles, and daring attacks by land!

	<name>Platoon [USA]</name>
	<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</desc>

	<name>Pooyan [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>

	<desc>It is the year 2191, and Earth's blissful existence was governed by a master computer. Then suddenly, its master control program malfunctioned, and people panicked ensuring total chaos. Secret Agent Nova is called in to locate agents located in six sectors. These agents hold an ID card which Nova must acquire to gain access to the security room within each sector. There, he must defeat the guards and obtain secret tape units, and if Nova obtains six of these, he will be able to gain entry to the control center and defeat the guard to destroy the computer and restore order to society.

Power Blade is a platform game, in which you must run through the level, destroying various enemies, and exit through the door. However, you can't leave each sector without locating agents.  By destroy enemies, you can get power-ups which restore your energy or upgrade your weapon. Occasionally, you can get a special power-up which transforms you into a Mech, which has a special attack mode and an three units of energy.

You must get through each sector before time runs out. You can leave a sector without getting the ID card and go to another sector, and come back when you're ready.

	<name>Power Blade 2 [USA]</name>
	<desc>Christmas Eve, 2200.

The Delta Foundation has just finished the development of a cyborg unit which represents a new generation of fighting robots. They want to sell it to the government's department of defense as it would pose a threat to the security of the nation if it is sold to a foreign country. They have asked the president, who is actually an alien from outer space, to consider their offer and respond in one week. The government takes this matter very seriously, and assigns Nova to destroy the Delta Foundation. Unfortunately, the government cannot be involved in the event that something might happen to him.

Power Blade 2 has six stages which involves you running through the level, while killing off enemies and avoiding hazards. At the start, you can choose which stage to start at, but unlike Power Blade, once you have chosen a stage, you can't exit and choose another one until you have completed the current one first. Nearly each stage involves you using your wits, as you dodge spikes, jumping towards the top of the screen to avoid fire, and getting fans to lift you onto platforms. You can also slide your way through tight spots, as long as you slide in the right place.

At the end of each stage, you fight a different boss. However, in the end, you must fight all the bosses you fought before before you get to fight the alien leader.

	<name>Power Blazer [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Power Blazer is an action/platform game by Taito. In the 21st century, the whole world is handled by a super-computer called the Brain Master. But one day, all systems start to inexplicably shut down at once. Humans have to accept the evidence, Brain Master has taken over the once gladdened Earth and plunged it into chaos. The player takes control of Steve Treiber, a highly trained soldier on a lone mission behind enemy lines. He is the only one capable of taking Brain Master offline and to save the world. Our young hero is armed with a powerful combat-boomerang called the 'Power Blazer'. Stages are fairly large and most of them have different routes to the finish line.
The American (and European) version of the game, called Power Blade, is significantly different than the Japanese version.</desc>

	<name>Power Punch 2 [USA]</name>
	<desc>Mark Tyler, the world's most famous boxer, boasts that he is absolutely invincible and that he can defeat any contender in the world. Nay, the universe! Well as luck would have it a race of alien fighters heard of Mark's claims and have decided to abduct him and pit him against the fiercest boxers in the galaxy.

Power Punch 2 is a one-on-one boxing game à la Punch Out, in which you control Mark as he battles all of the alien contenders in hopes of getting the galactic boxing belt. The game is played from a 3rd person perspective from which you see both fighters as they fight. You have rudimentary movement controls but the basic mechanics involve dodging and timing your attacks so that you can break the enemies patterns. Between fights you get to train in a gym, which involve taking part in a series of mini-games with the rewards being upgraded strength, speed or health for you upcoming bout.</desc>

	<name>P'radikus Conflict [USA] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>One day, the peaceful nation of the Lextorians discovers the planet P'radikus, where numerous uncivilized tribes are constantly at war with one another. When they steal a spaceship and start to expand their wars across the solar systems, you are trained by the elders to halt their dominance and destroy the home planet with a secret weapon known as "Thunderbolt".

Using the typical thrust movement from the Asteroids games, you roam space with your starship to return the peace by force. Starting as a rookie, many enemy ships need to be destroyed to earn credits that can be exchanged for fuel, armor, weapons, shields and warp drives. The commander instructs you with specific missions, such as destroying outposts or freeing alien groups. However, your ultimate goal is to find the Toson Drive, the only device powerful enough to reach P'radikus. To spice things up, there are many weapons such as shock waves, mines, missiles, cloaking devices and atomic cannons. As your fuel constantly depletes, you often need to orbit new planets to refuel and stock weapons.</desc>

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards.

An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

Princess Tomato is an adventure game in which you interact with the environment by choosing commands from a menu, such as the traditional "check" or "give", and the less traditional "praise" or "percy". Percy is a little persimmon who will be your trusty side-kick throughout your quest and who will help you on many occasions. The puzzles are on the simple side, and are primarily based on talking to characters, finding items and giving them.</desc>

It is possible to leave the ring; however, a player who does so must re-enter the ring before the referee's 20-count. Failure to do so results in a loss (via count-out) or a draw (double count-out), if both wrestlers fail to re-enter in time. (Note: The referee's count is broken only after both wrestlers have re-entered the ring. That is, as long as at least one wrestler is outside the ring, the referee's count continues. Moreover, it is possible for a wrestler to be counted out while executing a "plancha" if he has crossed the ring ropes by the count of 20.</desc>

	<desc>Here's the baseball action that started it all - the one, the only, the original RBI. With permission from the Major League Players Association, this game uses the names and likenesses of real baseball players. This means the ten different teams in the Tengen league can have lineups that include baseball stars of the time; such as Reggie Jackson, Fernando Valenzuela, and Willie McGee. Stats and abilities have been structured to give each player strengths and weaknesses he had in the 1986 and 1987 seasons. You'll have to use your knowledge of real players and teams to manage your lineup effectively.

The teams you can choose from include Detroit, California, Houston, San Francisco, and even the American and National League All-Star teams. In One-Player mode you compete with the computer for the pennant in a nine game season. If you want to go head-to-head with a friend, you can each pick your favorite team and then compete in your own best-of-seven series.</desc>

	<desc>R.B.I. Baseball 2 features all 26 major league teams, each with a full roster of players. You can choose any National or American League team. You can even play one of the 1989 All-Star squads.

R.B.I. Baseball 2 has One Player and Two Player options as well as a Password mode to enable you to play a full season (one game against every team in the division). In addition, a watch mode provides you with the best seat in the house for a computer-controlled match up.

R.B.I. Baseball 2 is similar to the original R.B.I. Baseball in terms of gameplay. This time around the game uses the teams and statistics from the 1989 season. Just as in the original, you get to see what it's like to step up to the plate as Ricky Henderson, pitch the ball like Nolan Ryan, and catch a line drive like Ozzie Smith.</desc>

	<desc>R.B.I. Baseball 3 took the popular baseball series a step further statistically, adding each Major League Baseball division winning team from 1983-1990, in addition to the 1989 All Star teams and all 26 1990 teams (with full 1989 statistics). Want to see how the 1986 Mets might have done against the 1987 Twins? Here's your chance.

The game was licensed by the Major League Baseball Players' Association; thus, real Major League players and statistics are included, but the teams themselves are represented only by their home cities. Team names are not used. Also, retired players who were no longer under contract with the MLBPA in 1991 are not present. Rather, they are represented by their initials and their fielding positions.

Game mechanics remain unchanged from R.B.I. Baseball 2, focusing more on arcade fun than realistic gameplay.</desc>

	<name>Punch-Out!! [Europe]</name>
	<desc>"Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream" is the reedition of the previous version "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!". Contrary to popular belief, Tyson was not removed because of his rape conviction (which did not occur until a year after the changeover), but because his contract expired. Since he had lost the title to James "Buster" Douglas by that point, Nintendo made no attempt to negotiate a new contract with him. Tyson was however, slated to appear in a sequel of his own (Power Punch II) where he would be the protagonist, but as a result of his imprisonment, Nintendo lost interest and instead used a generic boxer named Mark Tyler.
Due to Mr. Dream being a simple head-swap and recolor of Mike Tyson, Mr. Dream fights in exactly the same manner as Mike Tyson in "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!" but has a better fighting record. For the first 90 seconds of the first round, Mr. Dream can floor Mac with one uppercut. The player can block these punches to reduce the impact, but it isn't recommended, as they l end up with little health left after that. While Mr. Dream can't use "flooring punches" forever, his punches are quick, his reaction time is top-notch, and he's also a difficult opponent to fight. The pass code to fight him is 007 373 5963.

	<desc>The NES version of The Punisher is an on-rails shooter tracking behind Frank Castle as he trades fire with the gangs of some of his classic enemies. Aside from being one of the few NES rail shooters, the game features an uncommon amount of destructible items in its levels. You also have the ability to move Frank to the left or right of the screen to dodge incoming fire, or to hold down the fire button to lock him in place and move the aiming cursor.

The game features six "missions" with a number of varying environments and levels within them. Standard pickups of armor and increased firepower are present, as well as grenades which can be launched with the B button. Earning a 100% kill rating (as The Punisher would surely try to do) gives an unlimited "Super Gun" upgrade for the next stage.</desc>

	<name>Puzznic [Europe]</name>
	<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

	<desc>Players move around Cairo and other Egyptian locations such as a tomb and a tower in a front-person view, popularized by Wizardry and imitated in many early Japanese RPGs. Players can talk to people, gather clues, rest at inns and purchase new weapons and armor. Unlike most RPGs, the player character does not get stronger from leveling up; they simply gain more hit points. Stats like attack and defense (which are inexplicably hidden from the player) are determined entirely by the equipment worn.</desc>

	<desc>Pyramid is an action puzzle game similar to Tetris. Stones of various shapes and sizes fall from the top of the screen, and you need to move and rotate the stones so they fill complete lines at the bottom of the screen.

If you get in trouble, there are a limited number of bombs that can be used to clear a small section of stones at the bottom hopefully giving you more room to work with.

	<desc>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>

Drawing the rectangles using the "slow" method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced "kicks"), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing. Once you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to the next level.</desc>

	<name>Quattro Arcade [USA] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>Quattro Arcade is an collection of 4 action arcade games, all of which feature single and 2-player modes.

1. C.J.'s Elephant Antics: C.J. the elephant went and got himself caught in an elephant trap. One thing led to another and the next thing you know, he's in a Parisian zoo. He makes a break for it and vows to make his way back home to Africa, traveling through Paris, Switzerland, and Egypt in order to reach his destination. This game is a side-scrolling action game. Offensively, C.J. can toss bombs at myriad enemies in his path. He also has a parachute that allows him to glide safely down from great heights. 2 players can play this game cooperatively as 2 differently colored C.J. characters.

2. Stunt Buggies: this game involves 1 or 2 players piloting buggies around dangerous mazes filled with renegade buggies on a quest to collect all the bombs in order to escape the maze.

3. F-16 Renegade: your crazy professor has hacked into the US Air Force's computers and programmed all of the jets to fly off and start World War III. Since no one will believe your tale on this matter, you take it upon yourself to follow your professor's footsteps: you hack into the USAF computers yourself but to locate the F-16 training program so that you can then break into the air base and heist a jet in order to take down all of the malevolent computer-controlled jets. The action in this game consists of flying a jet and shooting other jets. However, the perspective alternates from overhead scrolling (odd levels) to 3rd person view from behind the jet (even levels). Powerups come in the form of stronger weapons, smart bombs, and extra lives. The game also features a 2-player competitive mode.

4. Go! Dizzy Go!: Dizzy's nemesis, the evil wizard Zaks, has abducted Dizzy's friends. Thus, the task falls to Dizzy to rescue them. To do this, he must collect fruit in a variety of dangerous mazes scattered throughout several worlds including an underwater realm, forest realm, a pyramid, a mountain, and a castle. Additionally, 2 players can team up to conquer the mazes.

All of the games feature 2-player modes. This is an unlicensed NES game.</desc>

	<name>R.B.I. Baseball [USA] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>Here's the baseball action that started it all - the one, the only, the original RBI. With permission from the Major League Players Association, this game uses the names and likenesses of real baseball players. This means the ten different teams in the Tengen league can have lineups that include baseball stars of the time; such as Reggie Jackson, Fernando Valenzuela, and Willie McGee. Stats and abilities have been structured to give each player strengths and weaknesses he had in the 1986 and 1987 seasons. You'll have to use your knowledge of real players and teams to manage your lineup effectively.

The teams you can choose from include Detroit, California, Houston, San Francisco, and even the American and National League All-Star teams. In One-Player mode you compete with the computer for the pennant in a nine game season. If you want to go head-to-head with a friend, you can each pick your favorite team and then compete in your own best-of-seven series.</desc>

	<desc>Here's the baseball action that started it all - the one, the only, the original RBI. With permission from the Major League Players Association, this game uses the names and likenesses of real baseball players. This means the ten different teams in the Tengen league can have lineups that include baseball stars of the time; such as Reggie Jackson, Fernando Valenzuela, and Willie McGee. Stats and abilities have been structured to give each player strengths and weaknesses he had in the 1986 and 1987 seasons. You'll have to use your knowledge of real players and teams to manage your lineup effectively.

The teams you can choose from include Detroit, California, Houston, San Francisco, and even the American and National League All-Star teams. In One-Player mode you compete with the computer for the pennant in a nine game season. If you want to go head-to-head with a friend, you can each pick your favorite team and then compete in your own best-of-seven series.</desc>

	<desc>R.B.I. Baseball 2 features all 26 major league teams, each with a full roster of players. You can choose any National or American League team. You can even play one of the 1989 All-Star squads.

R.B.I. Baseball 2 has One Player and Two Player options as well as a Password mode to enable you to play a full season (one game against every team in the division). In addition, a watch mode provides you with the best seat in the house for a computer-controlled match up.

R.B.I. Baseball 2 is similar to the original R.B.I. Baseball in terms of gameplay. This time around the game uses the teams and statistics from the 1989 season. Just as in the original, you get to see what it's like to step up to the plate as Ricky Henderson, pitch the ball like Nolan Ryan, and catch a line drive like Ozzie Smith.</desc>

	<name>R.B.I. Baseball 3 [USA] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>R.B.I. Baseball 3 took the popular baseball series a step further statistically, adding each Major League Baseball division winning team from 1983-1990, in addition to the 1989 All Star teams and all 26 1990 teams (with full 1989 statistics). Want to see how the 1986 Mets might have done against the 1987 Twins? Here's your chance.

The game was licensed by the Major League Baseball Players' Association; thus, real Major League players and statistics are included, but the teams themselves are represented only by their home cities. Team names are not used. Also, retired players who were no longer under contract with the MLBPA in 1991 are not present. Rather, they are represented by their initials and their fielding positions.

Game mechanics remain unchanged from R.B.I. Baseball 2, focusing more on arcade fun than realistic gameplay.</desc>

	<desc>This second Pro-Am racing game for NES introduces some innovations compared to its predecessor. Once again, you have to bring your red radio-controlled car to victory, score points, hit turbo speed lines, and leave no chance to your blue, green, and yellow adversaries. But you can also upgrade your engine and tires - if you can afford it, which means you'll have to think seriously about gathering those dollar signs scattered on the track. The tracks themselves have more variety, some have unusual enemies (little planes bombing you from above), and more kinds of obstacles. You also have several lives and don't die immediately if you arrived last.</desc>

	<name>Alex DeMeo's Race America [USA]</name>
	<desc>Race America is a 2-car cross-country racing game. Either 2 players can compete on the same screen, or the computer can control the second player. The game provides eight colorful opponents to race against, each of whom is supposed to have distinct advantages in a race. Each race begins from a side-scrolling perspective as the 2 competitors speed out of the gate. After a certain distance, the perspective shifts to third person and the driver in the lead occupies the top half of the screen while the driver in second is relegated to half of the lower screen. Occasionally, the game also employs an overhead view. To add to the challenge, the game's cars have 6-speed manual transmissions which players must shift using the control pad, but not while pressing the gas button.</desc>

	<desc>Rad Racer II is an arcade style racing game which is the sequel to Rad Racer and features similar gameplay. Played with a 3D perspective from behind your vehicle, the goal is to race through a series of different tracks before time runs out. Along each track are several checkpoints; crossing a checkpoint will increase the amount of time you have to reach the final destination. Eight new tracks are featured (with new graphics and music), each with a variety of hills, turns, obstacles, and other cars to get in your way. Crashing into other cars or any obstacles on the side of the road cause you to slow down or come to a stop and lose valuable time. Also new is a turbo boost which allows you to reach speeds of 255 mph. Unlike the original game, you now only have a choice of one car and the red-blue 3D glasses aren't supported.

	<name>Radia Senki - Reimei Hen [Japan]</name>
	<desc>You wake up in the middle of a forest. Your head hurts. You don't remember anything: you don't know who you are, and you vaguely recall your name. A man approaches you and says his name is Darus. After realizing that you are suffering from a strange amnesia, Darus takes you to a nearby village and soon reveals to you that he is a sorcerer on a quest for revenge. You join forces, and soon become involved in a complex mystery of a kidnapped princess, the destruction of the world, and search for your own identity...

Radia Senki is set in a semi-modern, semi-medieval environment, and introduces an unusual blend between action and strategic RPG. During the pre-set (not random) battles, your party and the enemies can freely move around the battle screen. You control the main character by attacking in real time, but you can pause at any time and give a command to other party members: attack a specified enemy, be offensive in general, use a healing or other technique, pretend to be dead, etc.</desc>

	<name>Rally Bike [USA]</name>
	<desc>There's a cross-country motorcycle rally going from San Fransisco to New York. In Rally Bike, the player has but one goal, to work their way up through the ranks of the racers and place high enough to qualify for the next race. The game contains six stages to race through.

The player controls a motorcycle and must cross the finish line before an established number of competitor bikes. The player must avoid crashing into obstacles, opposing racers, vehicles, and running out of gas. During a race there are certain areas where the player can refill their gas but stopping to refuel will cause competitor bikes to take advantage and race past the player. Competitors never run out of fuel but they are able to crash into obstacles thus taking them out of the race.

Occasionally during a race a helicopter will fly by dropping items that the player is able to pick up. The items are a 1000 Points Bonus, helper motorcycles that help you crash other racers, extra gasoline, Hi-grade gasoline which lasts longer than normal, a   turbocharger that gives extra speed, and a helmet which provides  invincibility.

If the player places in the top ten in a race, they are able to tune up their bike with better equipment. The player can upgrade their bike's engine (either 2 cycle type or 4 cycle type) and its tires(either rain, brock, or stick).</desc>

	<desc>John Rambo is a Special Forces solder that is currently spending time in military prison, well until Colonel Trautman decides that Rambo is the ideal solder to be sent on a special mission. Rambos mission is simple, go to Vietnam and photograph the POW camp there. He is also ordered not to engage the enemy or rescue any POWs.  In Vietnam, Rambo meets his contact, Co, and she sets up the passage to the POW camp. During the mission Rambo cannot bear just photographing the POW camp when he has an ample opportunity to rescue a POW in the camp. So Rambo, disobeying his orders, tries to rescue a POW, which is when it all starts to go wrong.

Rambo is a side scrolling platform game where the player controls Rambo with his mission to Vietnam. The game starts at the military base before getting sent to Vietnam. In Vietnam, Rambo has to fight animals in the jungles, swamps, and caves like wasps, snakes, fish, tigers, bats, spiders, birds, apes and flamingos. Before making his way to the POW camp he has to fight guards and mercenaries that can kick and shoot him, all wearing different color shirts depending on how powerful they are. The game also requires the player to navigate a complex map requiring the player to find North and South points on the ground to go up and down levels as well as East and West by moving Rambo to the edge of the screen.  There are 6 different weapons that Rambo can pick up that are knife, throwing knife, bow and arrow, bow and exploring arrow, gun, and hand grenade. All the weapons but the knife has limited ammo which is collected from killed enemies. There is also health vile that restores health as well as mission specific items that Rambo must find to complete some missions. The game uses password save that can be retrieved when talking to any person.</desc>

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human</desc>

	<desc>The Ghoul realm is under attack by a mysterious force and aspiring warrior Firebrand sets out to save it.

As in its predecessor, gameplay in Gargoyle's Quest II is divided into an adventure and an action part. During the adventure parts, Firebrand explores a world map and several villages from a top-down perspective, talking to his fellow ghouls and zombies to advance the story or receive important items. Action parts are seen from a side-scrolling perspective. In these parts of the game, Firebrand has the ability to jump, cling to walls, fly for a limited amount of time and shoot fireballs at his enemies. As the game progresses, Firebrand becomes more and more powerful, receiving items that improve his agility, armor or attack power.</desc>

	<name>Remote Control [USA]</name>
	<desc>Remote Control is based on the MTV quiz show of the same name. During the game three contestants (computer or human controlled) compete by answering questions about various TV shows, movies, characters, or actors/actresses. There are two rounds of gameplay followed by a third "think real fast" round. 

In the first two rounds of gameplay the gameboard consists of a giant TV with nine channels; one of the players chooses a channel (representing a particular category) revealing a question; the first player to buzz in and provide the correct answer earns points. The are a variety of categories available (some of these are "video high", "cop shows", "saturday night live", "soap operas", and many more) which will vary from game to game. Sometimes a surprise channel may appear which doesn't have a question, but awards or removes points from a player. These rounds end when all of the supplied questions have been exhausted. Near the end of the second round, the lowest scoring player is eliminated from the game leaving two players for the final round.

The final "think real fast" round lasts for thirty seconds; during this time the players need to answer as many short answer questions as possible to earn points. At the end of this round the player with the most points wins the game.</desc>

In the game, you control Ren &amp; Stimpy through various side scrolling levels which are based on different episodes of the cartoon show.  Episodes the levels are based on are Space Madness,Out West, and Robin Hoek. 

In Space Madness, Space Cadet Stimpy must get a dazed Ren to the sick bay to feed him some chicken soup to cure him of his space madness. You will guide Ren through the Space Diner, the Laboratory, the Button Room and the Zero Gravity Bathroom to get to the sick bay. There are also parts of this level in which you will control the spacecraft that involves side scrolling shoot em up gameplay.

Out West pits Three-Fingered Hoek and Stimpy the Kid, in the role of horse thieves. You must guide the buckeroos through the outskirts of town, past the corrals, through the rusty frontier town and to the stables, where you'll find the sheriff's horse to steal.

During Robin Hoek, Ren is the finest archer in all of Logwood Forest. Armed with trusty bow and turkey baster, you must make your way through the village and rescue the fair Maid Moron from the clutches of the evil sheriff, who is holding the maiden captive in his castle.</desc>

	<desc>This is the conversion of Taito's scrolling beat 'em up, which later produced unofficial sequels Target: Renegade and Renegade III: The Final Chapter.  The game is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.</desc>

River City Ransom is a side-scrolling beat-em-up similar to Double Dragon. The player, or players, travel through the locations of River City, encountering various gangs along the way. Gang members can be defeated with punches and kicks, or beaten up with objects scattered around. Upon their defeat, gang members drop money which Alex and Ryan can spend in malls to buy items that restore health and improve their combat abilities. The main characters have RPG-like numerical stats that can be improved this way, and can also buy books to learn combat manoeuvres. To finish the game, the player(s) have to find and defeat all the bosses.</desc>

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</desc>

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.</desc>

	<name>RoboWarrior [Europe]</name>
	<desc>In a desperate measure to combat the overpopulation of Earth, scientists work to create an artificial planet named Altile, named after the scientist who designed it. During the construction of Altile, humanity has become united and peaceful. During this new era of prosperity, Earth decommissions the RoboWarriors, a force of heavily armed half-man half-robot war vehicles. But from another dimension, aliens calling themselves the Xantho Empire and lead by the being Xur invade planet Altile and terraform it for their own uses. The survivors of Altile send out a distress call to Earth. Receiving this message, the people of Earth quickly activate the latest and most powerful of the RoboWarriors, a model known as ZED (Z-Type Earth Defense) and send it at top speed to Altile.

Controlling ZED from an overhead view, the player is able to move in any of 4 directions (up,down,left,right), drop bombs and shoot a projectile weapon. The terrain of Altile is made up of many obstacles and the bombs serve to destroy these and make passage for ZED. Destroying any enemy or obstacle may yield different power-ups which contain any of 10 different effects (including ammunition and energy refills) which may be stocked and used at any time from the menu. Or the power-ups may be instant-use refills for bombs and energy supplies.

Additionally some levels contain keys, which unlock doors and Chalices which prevent the level from running on endlessly. Secret areas such as a Well of Hope and a Room of Idols may also be found. Altogether, there are eight different "worlds" for ZED to conquer, containing numerous stages and guarded by a vicious boss monster.</desc>

Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</desc>

You are a brave warrior who has accepted the challenge of rectifying this situation. Using only a boomerang for offense, the hero descends into the depths of the underworld. The game begins with a flying/shooting side scrolling level and then proceeds to walking/jumping side scrolling action. All kinds of undead creatures (mostly skeletons) are waiting to destroy you.

Audibly, the game makes liberal use of digitized voices, a rarity for 8-bit NES games.</desc>

	<desc>Rock 'N' Ball is a pinball game with several gameplay options. The first is regular pinball game for one to four players. The second option is called nineball and the object is to shoot the balls into the playfield and have them land in the holes to form a bingo pattern (i.e. a vertical line, a horizontal line, etc.) This game is also for one to four players. Next is battle flipper. There is a set of flippers at both the top and bottom of the table, and two players try to knock the pinball past their opponents flippers. Lastly is sports pinball. In this game the pinball table is set up to look like a soccer or hockey field. Similar to battle flipper, each player tries to knock the pinball past their opponents goalie. There is only one flipper in this game, however you have a goalie to block shots and the flipper can be moved from side to side.

	<name>Rocket Ranger [USA]</name>
	<desc>In the 1940s, the Nazis built a base on the moon and plan to use a mysterious substance called Lunarium to reduce people's intelligence. However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</desc>

	<name>The Rocketeer [USA]</name>
	<desc>The Rocketeer is based on the 1991 Disney movie of the same name. Nazis are trying to steal an experimental jet pack that will presumably give them a strategic edge in modern warfare for the purpose of world domination. It is up to the hero to don the jet pack and the helmet to stop the Nazis and keep the world safe.

The Rocketeer is a side-scrolling, run-and-jump (and sometimes fly) game. About halfway through the first stage, the Rocketeer is able to scavenge jet fuel power-ups, in addition to health and ammo power-ups. The fuel power-ups allow him to use his namesake power and fly for short distances. The Rocketeer has 6 offensive options available from the start of the game, limited only by the amount of ammunition points he has in reserve: A punch (requires no ammo points and is therefore unlimited), pistol (1 ammo point per fire), tommygun (2 ammo points), spread gun (3 ammo points), grenade (5 ammo points), and a bazooka (20 ammo points).</desc>

	<name>Rockman [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In the future city of Monsteropolis, the use of robot labour has helped civilization grow more than ever before. At the forefront of this technology is Dr. Light and his assistant Dr. Wily, who are commissioned to build six robots to handle a variety of specific tasks. They are named Bombman, Gutsman, Iceman, Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman in reference to their individual prime functions. Dr. Wily, however, has bigger plans and chooses to take control of the robots and let loose destruction in a bid for world control. Dr. Light fights back with the best tool he has, an experimental human-like robot, Rock aka Mega Man, who had been tested to perform cleaning duties. Now properly armed, it's up to Mega Man to take on the maverick robots, fight his way into Dr. Wily's castle, and end this madness.

Mega Man is a side-scrolling platformer. Mega Man has the ability to jump and fire his weapon. He must travel to the levels of the six robot masters and defeat them in combat. By doing so, Mega Man is able to acquire their power for his own. These powers can then be used interchangeably with his main weapon and target the weaknesses of specific enemy bosses. Additionally, some hidden areas of the levels can only be accessed by using certain captured robot weapons. A special  Magnet Beam ability can also be found which can be used to create steps. 

Travelling throughout these levels, Mega Man is confronted by an army of lesser robot creations. Destroying these usually yields energy capsules (for refilling Mega Man's Energy), weapon capsules (for refilling Mega Man's special robot weapons), and extra lives shaped like Mega Man's head.</desc>

	<name>Rockman 2 : Dr. Wily no Nazo [Japan]</name>
	<desc>After defeating Dr. Light's six robots that were reprogrammed by the villainous Dr. Wily in Mega Man, it seemed like the world was safe.  But it was not to be.  Dr. Wily has escaped from prison and is madder than ever, this time creating eight new Robot Masters of his own to take over the world and crush Mega Man!  Is the world doomed?

Mega Man 2 is the sequel to the NES game Mega Man. In this game, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man and Wood Man are Dr. Wily's eight prize creations that have been sent to take over the world.  As Mega Man defeats these bosses, he can steal their powers and use them for himself.  Each Robot Master is weak against another's weapon, and through experimentation, Mega Man can gain the upper hand by using the weapon they're vulnerable against.

Other additions to the game include the 'E-Tank' - an item that can be used at any time to completely refill Mega Man's energy, and a Password System, which allows players to continue their game by recording which Robot Masters have been defeated and how many E-Tanks they have.  Mega Man 2 also removes the scoring system from the original game.</desc>

	<desc>"Calling Mega Man! Calling Mega Man! Come in please! ...."

This is a traditional action-platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Also, there is a mysterious character called Protoman who may or may not be your friend.

Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.

How do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels, even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows: Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, &amp;amp; Hard Man.

Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. And, of course, you do get infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.</desc>

A supposed colleague of Dr. Light's, the mysterious Dr. Cossack, has sent out eight of his own Robot Masters to find Mega Man, whom Cossack blames for the kidnapping of his daughter. Mega Man, hoping to clear his name, sets out to find Dr. Cossack, this time armed with a powerful new weapon: the Rock Buster!!

Rockman must now battle with Cossack's fiendish Robot Masters and find Cossack's daughter before it's too late!

Originally for the NES, Mega Man 4 was also released for the PSX in Japan as the fourth installment in the Rockman Complete Works series.</desc>

	<desc>Dr. Cossack, humbled by his defeat and his allowing of Dr. Wily to influence his ways, decides to help Dr. Light by providing him and Rockman with tools and weapons to help foil Dr. Wily for good. All seems calm and peaceful, until...

A sudden rampage breaks out, and the cause is found to be a group of robots, led by a mysterious figure. As Dr. Light begins to investigate this rampage and attempts to find a way to stop it, he is kidnapped by the leader of the robots. Rockman hurries to save Dr. Light, but is too late...the only thing he can find at the scene is a yellow scarf...one that almost seems to belong to...Blues!?

Could Rockman's supposed brother, the strange but good-hearted Blues, be the one who kidnapped Dr. Light? Is Blues the one responsible for the rampages? With these questions racing through his mind, Rockman sets off to find Blues and get the answers he wants.

Like the other early Rockman / Mega Man games, the Playstation version was only released in Japan, as part of the Complete Works series.</desc>

There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.

When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.

Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.

In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.</desc>

	<name>Rollerblade Racer [USA]</name>
	<desc>In Rollerblade Racer your goal is to enter (and hopefully win!) the super rollerblade challenge. In order to enter the race, you will first need to qualify by earning 5,000 points and completing several obstacle courses. As you rollerblade through the suburbs, city streets, beaches, and parks you can earn points by performing a variety of tricks and jumps. Additional points are earned by completing the course under the time limit. There are also several bonus rounds where you need to navigate through (or jump over) obstacles such as barrels or cones. In order to place in the super rollerblade challenge, you need to complete all of the events and the challenge with 10,000 points for third place, 15,000 for second, or 20,000 for first! If you crash too many times during an event or run out of time, the game will be over. The game allows you to select one of two characters, and features an isometric overhead point of view which scrolls to follow the action.</desc>

	<desc>This is a platform game in the same fashion as Turtles II, that is that it's a sidescroller were you can move up and down on the screen, but you go on rollerskates. This makes the game go much faster than its counterpart, which adds difficulty and also a sense of speed.

It includes a silly story about three different roller skates gangs (somewhat like motor cycle gangs) in a close future, which is most an excuse for the game to exist.

You can choose between three different gangs, one is all-around, one is fast and weak (and consists of women) and one is slow and strong, you get the fashion. This adds some replayability, but in reality, they are kind of the same.

The game also suffers from trial and error; you must learn the courses if you want to master them. Luckily, the game has unlimited continues.</desc>

The game concept is still the same, though they did improve a lot of features that one may consider 'disturbing' from RTK I (e.g. Generals dying easily due to disease, etc.). RTK can be said to be much more 'stable' where players no longer have to worry that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to build up their forces without much interference. The RTK II gameplay and interface is closely similar to Nobunaga's Ambition II.</desc>

The game is a departure from Dragon Slayer RPG-oriented gameplay style. It tends more towards medieval-themed platformer action. The hero has hit points, can buy items and weapons, use magic, and stay in inns to recover health. However, instead of receiving experience points and becoming stronger, you simply must attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump higher.</desc>

	<name>Saiyuuki World 2: Tenjoukai no Majin [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Whomp 'Em tells the tale of a little Native American Indian named Soaring Eagle who is on a quest to fill his magic pouch with totems. These totems are guarded by fearsome bosses at the end of different environments spread throughout the land. Each totem gives Soaring Eagle a new power to help him complete his journey.

Whomp 'Em is a side scrolling action platformer. The hero can run, jump, and attack with his spear. Not only can he jab forward with his spear, Soaring Eagle can also stab upwards or downwards while jumping. Further, he can use his spear to defend from attacks coming from above.

Soaring Eagle must first conquer a bossless, introductory level. From there, he is free to choose from among 6 different lands to explore: Fire test, ice ritual, secret cliff, water test, magic forest, and sacred woods. Each level is highly unique with its own dangerous enemies and lethal boss. After completing these 6 areas and collecting the associated totems, Soaring Eagle is whisked off to a cloud realm where he must use all of his accumulated power to defeat a much larger enemy.</desc>

	<name>Princess Tomato In The Salad Kingdom [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Many growing seasons ago, the Salad Kingdom was a peaceful land. But one day, minister Pumpkin betrayed king Broccoli, kidnapped princess Tomato, stole the royal Turnip Emblem, and took them to his castle in Zucchini mountains. He sent his cruel Farmies to terrorize the Salad Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, the king died, unable to recover from the loss of his beautiful daughter. But he promised you, the brave Sir Cucumber, the princess' hand and the entire kingdom, if you save the beautiful Tomato from the clutches of the evil Pumpkin. 

Princess Tomato is an adventure game in which you interact with the environment by choosing commands from a menu, such as the traditional "check" or "give", and the less traditional "praise" or "percy". Percy is a little persimmon who will be your trusty side-kick throughout your quest and who will help you on many occasions. The puzzles are on the simple side, and are primarily based on talking to characters, finding items and giving them.</desc>

	<desc>In a distant part of the universe, an alien creature called Zelos was born. As he grew so did his appetite, and soon he began devouring galaxies, planets, and stars by the hundreds. Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action packed shooter based on the arcade game. There are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields. Gameplay is for one player or two players simultaneously.

	<name>Satomi Hakkenden [Japan]</name>
	<desc>A Famicom RPG based on a famous Japanese novel series of the same name.
Satomi Hakkenden (usually translated as "The Eight Dog Chronicles") was a long-running 19th century novel series about eight samurais from the Sengoku period and their various adventures. It was in some ways partly inspired by the ancient Chinese epic The Water Margin, which has itself seen video game adaptations in the form of the Suikoden games. Receiving numerous TV and film adaptations, including the 1983 film known in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai, Satomi Hakkenden would be its first video game adaptation.</desc>

Under the command of the Master Control, named L-Brain, the Invaders defeat Earth's space forces. Only one hero, Captain Commando remains to defeat the alien armada by entering Balangool and fighting through the various sections until reaching Section-Z.

Section-Z is a side-scrolling shooter where the player must travel through the maze that is Balangool. Typically this consists of traveling through a scrolling corridor and reaching the end where a new direction must be chosen. Captain Commando's abilities are shooting directly left or directly right while moving around the screen. Power-ups can be collected by defeated enemies and include; improved lasers, a 3-way cannon and shield, these can be stored until needed. There are also SMS (Special Transmission Shell) power-ups, which require energy to use Energy units,are used to absorb enemy fire. Loss of all energy or running into an enemy or a wall causes death.

Certain sections of Balangool are blocked until a generator can be found and destroyed. There are four different boss creatures that must be defeated when encountered.</desc>

	<desc>Ta-Keed, the Prince of Darkness, has managed to escape from his supernatural penitentiary where he has had centuries to plot exactly how he will take revenge on those that locked him away. Emperor Hans sends his troops to deal with this threat, but they are no match for the ultimate evil one. As an alternative, the emperor summons the bearers of 4 Magical Bells. These 4 adventurers must make their way to the castle and work as a team if they are to destroy Ta-Keed.

The first part of Little Samson has each of the 4 characters journeying from his or her home land to the emperor's palace. This gives the player an opportunity to explore that character's unique abilities which will be essential throughout the game.

1. Samson is a human who is reasonably fast and also possesses magnificent rock climbing prowess. He is able to scale walls and hang across ceilings, and also grab onto walls and ceilings while jumping. His offensive option is the ability to shoot bells straight ahead.

2. Kikira is the Dragon Lord. Since she has claws, she does not slip on ice. When she jumps, she can also fly for short bursts. She breathes fire in 2 intensities, depending on how long the player holds down the fire button. Her fireballs spread in arc patterns.

3. Gamm is the Rock Lord. Since he is a living rock he is very strong. So strong in fact that spikes do not hurt him, which is very valuable in a number of situations. He is also very slow and has only a short leap. He has a powerful punch.

4. K.O. is the Mouse Lord. He is tiny which allows him to enter areas that other team members can not. He is also extremely fast and the highest jumper of the team. However, he is the weakest member so he can not sustain very much damage. He has the same wall and ceiling traversal abilities as Samson. Offensively, he can drop time-delay bombs.

When all 4 characters reach the emperor's palace, they all jump into Samson's bell. Actually, Gamm and K.O. quietly jump into Samson's bell; Kikira initially refuses. After a brief fight (with the player controlling Samson), Kikira joins the effort. Throughout the rest of the game, the player can switch between any of the 4 characters by entering the sub-screen. Each character has their own power meter. However, all the characters share lives. If the presently selected character loses all of his or her power, then one life is lost. The player must swap between all 4 characters in order to complete the journey.</desc>

	<desc>The boy Michimune and the girl Miu happily live in a small house together with their wise old grandfather. One day, just when they were about to celebrate Miu's birthday, the room suddenly became dark, and an evil demonic figure appeared out of nowhere. Ironically, the dark being addressed your grandfather, saying it's been a long time. Apparently, grandfather also knew who or what this figure was, since he called him by the name Rosenkreuz. Rosenkreuz explains that he has waited a hundred years, but now it is possible to bring back the God of Evil, and to control the world! But for an unknown reason, he needs Miu. Rosenkreuz strikes your grandfather, and kidnaps Miu! Before grandfather dies, he could only whisper: "Save... Miu...". And thus, Michimune embarks on a dangerous journey to the land of evil, to save Miu from the clutches of Rosenkreuz.

"Seirei Gari" is a horror-themed adventure game along the lines of the more known  Uninvited or  Deja Vu. Every action is performed by choosing a command from the menu. You should examine every location before objects become "visible" and possible to interact with. Sometimes you'll also have companions at your side who will help you on your quest.</desc>

Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles.

Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</desc>

	<desc>In the 21st century, the evil Emperor Garuda has taken over the city of New York, killing many of its inhabitants. You play as either Hayate or Kaede, two ninjas who are attempting to free the city from Garuda's control.

Shadow of the Ninja is a typical side-scrolling action game, consisting of running, slashing and jumping through 5 levels, each with 4 sub-stages with numerous and varied foes, and a boss enemy at their end.

Kaede and Hayate can not only jump; as ninjas, they can hang from platforms and make swift saltomortals between floors. Sometimes, canisters containing powerups can be found. Typical powerups extend range of the default sword, or they may be additional weapons such as throwing stars and a ninja weapon that looks like a big grappling hook on a string.

The game allowed two players to play cooperatively, a rare feature for action games outside of the Contra series.

	<desc>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which 2 ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</desc>

Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps.

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at you suddenly, unexpectedly, and most of all OFTEN. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause you to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. It's allso worth mentioning the fact that if your torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and you forget to light a new one, you'll trip in the dark and break your neck.

	<name>Shadowgate [USA]</name>
	<desc>Using the same graphical interface as Deja Vu, Shadowgate is an adventure game set in a fantasy world. Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps.

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at you suddenly, unexpectedly, and most of all OFTEN. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause you to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. It's allso worth mentioning the fact that if your torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and you forget to light a new one, you'll trip in the dark and break your neck.

A Windows 3.x update to this game was created in 1991.</desc>

	<desc>Shatterhand is an action game with eight-direction scrolling. You control Shatterhand in his quest to find and defeat General Grover, leader of the Metal Command. Through the game youll encounter all kinds of mechanical and biomechanical creatures. Shatterhands primary weapon is his cybernetic fists and therefore most enemies must be defeated by punching them.

Additional help can be given from any of the eight hovering satellite robots, each of which has its own weapon that fires automatically when Shatterhand throws a punch. These satellite robots can be obtained by collecting combinations of alpha-beta letters that appear when you punch some of the white boxes that are scattered throughout each stage.

The game has seven stages. The first and the last must be played first and last respectively, but the five middle stages can be played in any order. The path to the final showdown with General Grover leads through a factory, a refinery, an anti-gravity research facility, a submarine, a burning subway, a filtration plant and finally to General Grovers missile launch complex.</desc>

	<desc>The game is based on the detective story Ghost Train, the first one written by the popular Japanese author Akagawa Jiro. You play a young detective who investigates a strange case: eight people have disappeared, and rumors are heard about a mysterious Ghost Train. You head to a remote village to learn more about those events. In this adventure game, you can move your hero from third-person perspective, but you can leave a screen only via a menu command. The menu is unique to each location; in some of them, you'll be able to investigate a room by moving around a cursor and clicking on objects, while in others you'll talk to people about various topics.

	<desc>In Shockwave you need to retrieve powerful crystals left behind by the Tarian race. The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.</desc>

	<name>Shooting Range [USA]</name>
	<desc>The aim is to shoot the discs on the screen so that you can acquire enough points to pass the clearing point score of that particular stage without your time or energy running out. You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250 and the 3rd difficulty level only 200.
Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which        extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points.
The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.</desc>

	<desc>One puck, and only two competitors. One is the computer, and the other is, of course, you. You get a chance to match your skills at this Air Hockey style game, over 'Cantina Band' inspired music. Deflect the puck around the walled area using your bat, trying to knock it into your opponent's goal.

There are several competitors, from which some of them definitely cheat, so be prepared to be laughed at. However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glassbreaks first.</desc>

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).</desc>

	<desc>The Silver Surfer roams throughout space as herald to Galactus, looking for new planets for him to feed on. However his mission is interrupted by a summon from Galactus. Silver Surfer learns that creatures from the Magick Dimension are trying to break through into the universe and their coming will end all life. Vowing to stop them, Silver Surfer must assemble the pieces of a mysterious Cosmic Device and use it to push them back. The pieces of the Device are currently in the hands of some malicious creatures: Reptyl, Mephisto, Skrull Emperor, Possessor and Firelord. Silver Surfer must travel to their domains and defeat them in order to obtain pieces of the device.

Silver Surfer is a shooter game, with some levels taking place vertically and some horizontally. The Surfer's only ability is to move around on the screen and to shoot directly in front of him. Power-ups that can be picked up include: the letter "F" (Firepower) which will increase the number and power of his projectiles, Smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen, the letter "S" (Speedup) which increases the surfer's movement and Orbs which will also fire the Surfer's weapon. Orbs are special in that two can be obtained (only 1 is shown on horizontal scrolling levels) and they can be positioned to fire forwards, backwards or sideways.</desc>

	<name>The Simpsons - Bart Vs. the Space Mutants [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

	<name>The Simpsons : Bart vs the Space Mutants [USA]</name>
	<desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

	<desc>This game is actually a compilation of smaller games belonging to different genres. Krusty the clown appears in the beginning of the game and presents a menu with five games to play (one of which is not available from the start): A jump-and-run game, where Bart must find an exit on a ship, while enemies fire at him and try to prevent him from reaching the exit; a card game, where you have five tries to find hidden cards on a board; a simple jigsaw puzzle; a series of trivia questions concerning the Simpsons; and finally, a platform-skateboard game (available only after you have completed the ship level). Needless to say all games are connected to the famous TV series "The Simpsons".

	<name>The Simpsons - Bartman Meets Radioactive Man [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Bart Simpson is reading the latest comic about the Radioactive Man but his favourite superhero is not featured in it. When he is at the last page, his sidekick Fallout Boy appears. He tells Bart he is the only one who can save Radioactive Man who has been sent to the Limbo Zone, a mysterious prison that revolves around a black hole. Bart turns into Bartman and he has to fight three super villains to collect Radioactive Man's lost powers before facing the mastermind Brain-O the Magnificent.

Players control Bartman through 2D side-scrolling platform levels. He needs to defeat enemies, collect goodies, and be careful not to fall into one of the deadly traps on his way. Bartman can punch and kick, and collect lightning icons to shoot small bolts. Most of the level sequences require precise timing and pixel-perfect jumping precision. Bartman has five life points that are restored by collecting radioactive signs.

	<desc>Skate or Die incorporates five distinct styles of skating, which can be attempted individually or in turn. You skate around a menu room to choose which one to attempt. Before taking off you can visit Rodney's skate shop to buy equipment.

The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is to score as many points as possible in 10 attempts. Judges determine how much style and skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same equipment, only this time your task is to jump as high as possible at the end of the ramp.

The downhill events are overhead-view races. In the Downhill Race you simply try to complete the course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you try to outperform a human or computer opponent whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You can use attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock your opponent over. 

The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up using a stick, set within a pit to skate around.</desc>

	<desc>In this sequel to Skate or Die, you have the option of just skateboarding on a ramp, or to go through an adventure. In the adventure, you are in a small community called Elmood. You play as the hero in this game. Basically you are trying to keep skateboarding and your life as it was after the Mayor of the town bans skateboards. After dealing with this, you set out to build your own halfpipe, and you deal with whatever comes your way. In this game, you go through many obstacles, and other skateboarders shooting paint and throwing eggs at you, you also can shoot at them, and of course upgrade your board from Lester when you run into him on his skateboard, as well as Lester who will give you tricks (giving them whatever they want, whether that's fries, drinks, CD's, etc;).

You can also fight side by side with a friend (who controls the pirate you didn't choose).

Fighting works like fencing, with a few different moves to use, including parrying. The levels scroll through with a boss at the end of each. You gain money by vanquishing foes and digging for treasure where X marks the spot.</desc>

To complete a mission, you simply need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes.

You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.</desc>

	<desc>In Slalom you need to ski down different trails and beat the clock to move on to the next of the 24 trails. Other skiers, trees, snowmen, sledders, and moguls will get in your way and slow you down if you crash into them. Slalom flags are located throughout the trails, and skiing on the wrong side of these will cause your player to snowplow momentarily and lose speed, so to get the best times you need to make sure none of the flags are missed.</desc>

	<name>Smash T.V. [Europe]</name>
	<desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

	<name>Snake's Revenge [Europe]</name>
	<desc>An unofficial sequel to the original Metal Gear for the NES. Three years has passed since the Outer Heaven incident. FOX-HOUND has gained intelligence that an unknown terrorist group has seized a remote facility containing mass-produced Metal Gear tanks, as well as a new Metal Gear prototype which was under development. The newly-promoted Lt. Solid Snake is called back into action to infiltrate the terrorists' base with the help of two FOX-HOUND rookies, former marine Nick Myer and navy intelligence agent John Turner.

The player once again assume the role of Snake. The objective is similar to the previous game, as the player must avoid any kind of visual contact (even moreso than the first game), while collecting weapons and equipment on-site. There is a greater variety of areas such as a jungle, a warehouse, a train, a couple of prisons and even a cargo ship containing the mass-produced Metal Gears. The player must also overcome new traps such as searchlights, soldiers in gyrocopters, door-sealing devices and even suicide bombers. The player must also interrogate captured enemy officers by injecting them with a truth serum to increase their rank, in addition to saving hostages like in the first game. Side-scrolling areas are also included in addition to the main overhead game, where the game takes a more action-oriented route (while still maintaining the stealth premise).</desc>

	<desc>The Silly Sports are being held in it's traditional home of Italy and Snoopy, from the Peanuts comic strips, will want to attend. Snoopy packs his plane and brings along his relative, Spike as an opponent and the little yellow bird, Woodstock to judge. 

Now Snoopy's ready to compete with 1 or 2 players in his own custom olympiad of the following "events":
The Sack Race: Snoopy and Spike race against one another in  competing potato sacks.
Boot Throwing: Just like the Hammer toss, but involving an old boot.
Pogo: Hop on a Pogo Stick and hop over obstacles.
Overboard: Snoopy and Spike play "King of the Boat" trying to knock each other into the water.
Pile of Pizza: Balance the pizzas while trying to walk towards the finish line.
River Jump: Pole Vault over the river (actually sticking the pole into the river) to the other side.

The Japanese version of this game uses a Donald Duck license rather than a Snoopy license (changing many of the character names above), but gameplay remains the same.

Now Nick and Tom find themselves with abilities dealing with snow and ice. These two Snow Brothers will need to hunt down the evil King Scorch and rescue the princesses.

Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use  snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into  giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually  defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.

In Downhill the object is to get down the slope as fast as possible. In Slalom you have to guide the board between the gates. In halfpipe, you have to perform stunts on a half pipe. In Moguls, you have to jump over both small and large moguls. In Backwoods, you'll be given different obstacles to contend with and you'll have to find away to get around them.

You also earn points by executing various stunts along the way. Stunts you can pull off are a toe grab, hand-plant, mid-air 360, and a mule-kick.

There are three different peaks, each featuring a couple different runs. The mountain ranges consist of Poseur Peak, Scary Summit, and Mt. Mortified.</desc>

Your task is to arrange those bubbles on the top of the play field in such a way that they create a line of several bubbles of the same color. When you succeed, the bubbles of the same color will disappear. When the whole play field is filled by bubbles, you lose. There are two types of gameplay (one grants you powerups which allow you to clear quickly a large amount of bubbles), with four stages each. You'll get various mildly erotic scenes after completing the stages, and a "reward" in the end. There is also a two-player mode.</desc>

	<desc>All weekend ballplayers know softball's no joke, but that doesn't mean you can't have a little fun with it. And when you step up to the plate in this cart you'll find the wackiest bunch of players to ever hit a softball diamond!

Play seven inning fast or slow-pitch games. In One Player mode, you face the computer in a five-game elimination tournament. Win them all, and you earn the right to challenge the awesome Amazons - All-Star Softball's all-time championship team. Of course, you and a friend can play each other in a head-to-head contest.

There are no preset ball clubs so you recruit 10-member squad from a roster of 60 weird players. Look for players who have strong basic baseball skills such as arm strength and speed. But to win on some of the tricky fields you'll also need players with more unusual skills - such as climbing fences, diving into water, and flying at night

In fast pitch, you hurl that baby in three speeds. But stay alert, base runners steal and batters bunt. In slow pitch, you can lob the ball short or long. You can also make your pitches curve right or left.Fielding the ball takes practice, but your guys can also dive for hard grounders and leap up to snare line shots. For quick double plays, infielders can tag a base then throw the ball.

With six softball fields to choose from, including the Sandlot, the Cliff, and a Professional field, there's some great action. Get ready to take yourself out to the softball park.</desc>

	<desc>The golden warpship was once the most powerful ship in the galactic fleet. But the ship was captured by aliens, and its parts scattered throughout twelve different worlds. On each world deadly aliens, booby traps, black holes, and extreme gravitational forces guard the parts. It is now up to Solar Jetman to land on each of the worlds and retrieve all the parts so the golden warpship may be reassembled.

At the beginning of each world, Solar Jetman starts out at the mother ship and explores using a jetpod. When a part of the golden warpship or something else of use is located, the jetpod can be used to haul it back to the mother ship. The mother ship will move on to the next world when all the parts on the current world have been brought back. If the jetpod takes too much damage, Solar Jetman must return to the mother ship for repairs before continuing the quest.

	<name>Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship [USA]</name>
	<desc>The golden warpship was once the most powerful ship in the galactic fleet. But the ship was captured by aliens, and its parts scattered throughout twelve different worlds. On each world deadly aliens, booby traps, black holes, and extreme gravitational forces guard the parts. It is now up to Solar Jetman to land on each of the worlds and retrieve all the parts so the golden warpship may be reassembled.

At the beginning of each world, Solar Jetman starts out at the mother ship and explores using a jetpod. When a part of the golden warpship or something else of use is located, the jetpod can be used to haul it back to the mother ship. The mother ship will move on to the next world when all the parts on the current world have been brought back. If the jetpod takes too much damage, Solar Jetman must return to the mother ship for repairs before continuing the quest.

	<name>Solomon no Kagi [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Solomon's Key is a platform game with both action and strategy elements. On each level your goal is to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit. To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you play the role of either Son Son or Ton Ton as you try to rescue your three friends from the clutches of a random bad guy who kidnapped them right in front of you. This game is a side scrolling adventure, where the game field advances automatically, and the screen is divided in six different floors, all of which are populated by enemies or obstacles that will kill you if you touch them; but both Son Son and Ton Ton attack their enemies by shooting small bullets at them out of their weapons (a magic cane and a pitchfork, respectively). Their attack can also stop many enemy projectiles! Your chosen character must jump from floor to floor, evading hunters, bats, fish, statues, insects, skull coins, and mad bombers! As you advance, you can pick up several food items to increase your score. Clearing the screen of enemies will also net you several hefty bonuses.

The story is heavily based upon &amp;quot;Journey To The West&amp;quot;; the player characters as well as the kidnapped ones are based upon the main characters in the story. This game is also a port of Capcom's original arcade game.

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

Power-ups make Billy and Jimmy twice their size, increasing their damage done and range of attack.

	<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>

	<name>Space Shuttle Project [USA]</name>
	<desc>The Launch Director has assigned a Commander to take control of several NASA Space Launches to do some necessary jobs in space. It is the commanders job to do all the pre-launch activities like fuelling the space ship and making sure all the crew are on safely and making sure all the post-launch activities are carried out like the rocket and fuel tank separation as well as the successful landing of the shuttle. The commander is also responsible for the extravehicular activities in space such as launching a satellite and building a space station.

Space Shuttle Project simulates a Space Shuttle mission from pre-launch to landing. After writing in a name, the player is presented with a mini game that requires the player to memorise numbers and a space shuttle name to get pass security. After security the space shuttle project is split into four different stages each with there own challenges as follows:

1. Stage 1 - Fuel and Board Shuttle: This stage requires the commander to use the lift to turn the oxygen and hydrogen switches on and open the shuttle doors. Then the commander must move down and up the lift picking up the crew needed for the mission (increases as the levels get harder) while avoiding sliders that cross in lifts path. This task has to be done within the time limit.

2. Stage 2 - Space Shuttle Launch: This stage requires the commander to control the space shuttle into orbit while disconnecting the rocket boasters (SRB) and the external tank (ET). All this is controlled by playing two mini-games that require the player to ether stop the power bar at the correct point or by moving the bottom arrow left and right to match the movements of the top arrow. A third mini-game is added later that requires the player to memorize the correct combination

3. Stage 3 - Extravehicular Activities: The activities that are competed in space vary depending on the mission. Mission 1 requires the commander to release a satellite into space navigating it to avoid all the other moving satellites that are littered though space. Missions 2, 4, and 6 requires the commander to build a part of a space station by grabbing a block from the shuttle and moving it into the correct part of the space station while avoiding satellites and making sure the oxygen levels dont run out. Mission 3 requires to move and from a damaged satellite avoiding space rocks and repair it. Mission 5 is like mission 3 but to rescue a stranded Soviet cosmonaut.

4. Stage 4 - Reenter Atmosphere and Land:This stage requires the commander to control the ship into reentry and land the space shuttle on a landing strip. The mini-games are the same as the space shuttle launch expect the D-pad is used for stopping the power bar.

There are 6 different missions with each mission a being more difficult than the last and only five fails aloud before the whole mission fails. Password save is available by adding the supplied password numbers and space shuttle name instead of the memorized numbers at the security check.</desc>

	<name>Spartan X 2 [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Somewhat more faithful to the plot of the movie than the first Spartan X game, it attempts to tell the same story: In Barcelona, Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Silvia. In order to get her back, Thomas, a Kung-Fu master who runs a restaurant must travel the city, eventually reaching Mr. X's castle and attempt to rescue her.

Spartan X 2 is an expanded version of the original Spartan X game (aka Kung-Fu). Similar to that game, Spartan X 2 is a side-scrolling fighting game. Controlling Thomas, the player is able to move left and right, jump, kick and punch. Thomas has an energy bar and is defeated if he loses all of the energy. Some enemies drop items such as potions which will help replenish this bar. At the end of each level, Thomas encounters a boss.

Story cutscenes are displayed between each level, where Thomas contacts other characters through use of a computer.</desc>

	<desc>The beautiful Fairy Land has been ruled by the evil demon Geyla for a thousand years. You are a nameless spelunker who is searching for treasure. You are told to defeat Geyla and to free the Fairy Land. But you are unsure about your motivation. Do you really wish to save the world, or are just interested in all those treasures buried deep in mountain caves, waiting for you to find them and to pick them up? You have a special meter called Toku that will indicate exactly how much you are interested in saving the world, and how much in grabbing treasures. Your actions will influence the outcome of the story...

The gameplay is platform action with some RPG elements (such as the ability to use different weapons or to follow a specific style or behavior). You travel overworld through forests, fields, and mountains, whacking or shooting enemies, facing ferocious bosses, and descending underground, searching for treasure. There are many hazards that await you on your journey, including lava fields, pits, etc.

"Doctor Octopus is plotting the crowning caper of his criminal career... to rule the world.
He has reunited the Sinister Six and with these super-villains together again, nothing stands in their way - except Spider-Man!"

Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six is a side-scrolling game which puts you in the role of Spidey throughout six levels against Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin and Doctor Octopus respectively. Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles.

Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.</desc>

	<name>Splatter House - Wanpaku Graffiti [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Wanpaku Graffiti is the first Splatterhouse game to appear on a home console. It is not clear how it fits in the series' timeline, but it starts with Jennifer mourning over Rick's grave (her boyfriend). Lightning strikes his grave and he is resurrected. Before she can rejoice, another bolt strikes the grave next to him and a jack-o-lantern appears. This pumpkin king kidnaps Jennifer and Rick barely has the time to wipe off the dust from his clothes before he sets off to rescue his girlfriend.

Although the game is not as gory as the other titles, there is still plenty of disturbing enemies such as headless chickens, severed hands and zombies. Through seven side-scrolling levels, including a graveyard, a mansion, a Japanese pagoda and an Egyptian pyramid, you chase the pumpkin king with your cleaver and a shotgun you can pick up along the road. Just like the other games in the series, there are lots of movie references. The game often needs good timing and pixel perfect jumps, as falling down from platforms will regenerate the enemies. You can pick up candy, hamburgers and cans of soda to restore your health.

	<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>

	<desc>M.A.D. magazines comic strip of the same name comes to life in this game which was designed for one or two players. The innovative split-screen shows both spies at the same time. Play with a friend or against the machine.

The black crow and the white crow are out to beat each other before the time bell rings. Find the needed objects by digging through drawers, closets and furniture in the house. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance).

Fights ensue when both spies enter the same room.  Find hidden weapons in the rooms to help with those fights, since one of you will die if you run into each other.

	<name>Sqoon [Japan]</name>
	<desc>When the rulers of planet Neptune find that they are running out of their main food source  man-ham  they hit on a devious plan: Invade the nearby planet earth and melt the polar ice-caps, thus sinking all cities. Then imprison the human creatures in underwater factories where they can be turned into a fresh source of man-ham.

The plan goes perfectly. The leaders of earth's nations are taken completely by surprise as the ice-caps melt and the globe is flooded. It seems that humanity will meet its end on the dinner plates of the Neptunian monsters. But wait! One hope remains, in the form of evil pirate Narikeen, who has been the scourge of the world's nations, pillaging and causing general distress in his pink submarine, Sqoon. The leader of the world's ailing defense force turns to this former public enemy number 1, and with some difficulty manages to convince Narikeen to save the world.

In this side-scrolling shooter, you control Narikeen's sub, Sqoon. Sqoon is equipped with two weapons; an upgradable missile launcher which shoots straight ahead to take out the weird Neptunian enemies and an ice-bomb which shoots horizontally downwards to blow up factories and other installations. Destroying these buildings releases the humans inside, who then float out so you can rescue them. When you have nine people on-board, a small mobile island will appear on the surface, allowing you to drop off the humans and re-fuel. You'll need to save a lot of people and re-fuel regularly, as your sub only lasts about 60 seconds on one tank of gas. There are eight levels in the game, each set in a different (sunken) country.</desc>

	<name>Square no Tom Sawyer [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In 1855, Tom Sawyer and his friends are growing up in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri in the United States. Being wild children, Tom Sawyer and his best friend Huckleberry Finn are always getting into new adventures and one kind of trouble or another. So it's not entirely unexpected one day when Tom Sawyer heads off to school and realizes he is late...

Square no Tom Sawyer is a side-scrolling RPG that features characters and situations from Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer novels. Players control Tom himself and up to three other characters who can join his party at any one time. In town, there are a variety of people that can be talked to and shops where items can be bought and sold. Outside of towns, monsters and fierce woodland animals are randomly encountered and must be battled with. When entering battle mode, the game shifts to a third-person view behind Tom's party. The player can issue commands such as Fight, Item and Run to each of the characters in the party and these actions will occur in turn. Battles that are won earn the participating characters experience points. These experience points can be allocated to increase specific stats of characters. Players can accumulate new items for use in battle but never have to deal with equipping characters.</desc>

	<desc>The game opens on a vegetative theme: siblings Maru and Cori are sent to bed early for not eating their vegetables, whereupon they drift off to sleep and dream together. Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! "Lettuce check it out," urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. "I yam King Kale," he says, "Won't you peas peas help me?" Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.

It seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and "vegetable-themed" guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.

Our two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.</desc>

	<desc>Set up R.O.B. with the colored discs included in the game and then control his movements in the game by using Professor Hector to jump onto various blocks. The blocks represent commands given to R.O.B. in sequence.

This game can be played in several different ways.  In the regular game, you have to stack up the colored discs as fast as possible and in a certain pattern and sequence. In memory mode you program an entire sequence of movements to move the discs and won't know if it actually works until you RUN the program. Finally there is a 1 or 2 player bingo mode in which you align different columns and rows to BINGO and activate rob commands. An opponent will also hop around activating commands. Your goal is to have R.O.B. move as many of the colored discs without dropping them.</desc>

	<name>Stanley : The Search For Dr. Livingston [USA]</name>
	<desc>The game is set in Congo, Africa, in 1870, and its main character is a historical figure. You play as Henry M. Stanley (1841-1904), a reporter for the New York City Newspaper, who was sent by his employers to chronicle the work of the famous Africa-explorer, Dr. Livingston. Unfortunately, the Doctor left without you, hating press and everything connected to it. Recently he disappeared somewhere in the jungle of Congo, leaving only a few notes. Apparently, he was on the trail of
re-discovering the legendary lost temple of the Amut people, Am-Zutuk. You decide to follow his steps, to find the lost Dr. Livingston, and maybe to learn more about the mysterious people of Amut and the temple.

The game takes you to Congo, where you can move from location to location on a "world map" with about a hundred accessible areas. You should make your way through platform levels populated with wild animals and other foes. Some of the levels are impassable or serve no purpose, others contain valuable clues and useful items. You can also visit town areas and talk to people. There is a variety of weapons to be found during your quest, including "native" ones such as blowpipe and spear.

	<desc>Save the humanoids from the impending aliens in the sequel to Defender. The task is still rescuing humanoids before Landers can turn them into Mutants, while avoiding and shooting other foes, however you must now carry humanoids to safety through the Stargate of the title. 

Entering this Stargate not only warps you to the nearest humanoid in jeopardy, but can also warp you ahead (while on the first 15 levels) if you enter it with 4 or more humanoids, and give you extra lives if you warp with 10 humanoids, so there is a trade-off between guaranteeing the safety of existing humanoids, and trying to advance your position

There are more enemies on screen than ever before. The Inviso button makes you invisible to enemies, but also to yourself, so you will have to follow your bullets to work out where on the screen you are.</desc>

	<name>Star Trek : 25th Anniversary [Germany]</name>
	<desc>The Ship Enterprise is on a 5 year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. While the Enterprise is investigating strange gravitational disturbances, it is drawn into a dimensional hole and ends up in unknown space with broken warp engines. Now, Captain Kirk and his crew must try to repair the ship and find a way home.

Gameplay is divided into two parts, taking place on the ship's bridge and away missions. On the bridge, you can communicate with other ships, call up a map to navigate the ship (once the warp engines are fixed), enter battle mode to fight other ships (which does not happen very often), save the game or beam down to a planet's surface.
These away missions make up the major part of the game and play very much like other action adventures. You can talk to aliens find and use objects, solve puzzles and fight against hostile lifeforms.  Battles with other ships or on away missions are handled in simple Shoot'em Up-fashion.

	<desc>Cadets at Starfleet Academy must spend some of their classes in the starship simulator. This year is a simulation of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Substituting for Jean-Luc Picard, cadets will take the role of captain and then must access different crew members (functions of the ship) to complete a series of scripted missions.

Star Trek: The Next Generation is divided into a series of missions. Players will start on the main screen of the bridge and from there can access Navigation, Tactical, Operations, Engineering, Transporter Systems and Mission Control. Mini-games are sometimes used to complete certain ship functions (such as rerouting power to the shields).

	<desc>CosmoStation Noah, located in Spiral Galaxy IX, is under siege by Molok Wardrivers. Now it's time for the pilot of the RH119 to fend off the Molok Wardrivers and save the CosmoStation.

Star Voyager's gameplay requires the player to venture through various sectors of the galaxy in search of different alien fleets so they can be defeated. Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade the player's equipment to fight off the enemy fleets. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship's warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If players do not warp to different sectors wisely, they might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.</desc>

	<name>Stealth ATF [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Stealth ATF is a flight simulator in which you pilot a F-117A, a.k.a. Nighthawk in several missions.

In every mission's beginning and ending you have to take off and land your plane respectively, from a side view. If you fail to land after completing the target objectives, you fail to succeed in mission and thus have to replay it.

Your view during the flight is from inside the cockpit, and the gameplay offers total freedom of movement on flight. Your terrain is infinite, and your enemies will re-appear in your radar every time they fly out of range. You fly in different locations, such as the Middle East, Alaska, the Pacific, etc. During flight, you can also turn off the music and play with only the flight sounds.

Your mission is to defeat a fixed number of enemies each mission. Your targets will always be aerial ones. You can shoot a cannon (which ammunition is unlimited) or missiles (8 per mission). If an enemy shoots you a missile, you can try to avoid it using the stealth mode (pressing the start button) once per mission. The stealth mode will automatically turn off once you pass out of the danger. If you manage to accomplish the mission perfectly, a bonus round is offered, and you have to try to take down as many enemies as you can.

The game can be played by one or two player taking turns. A second player can also take control of the aircraft closest to the center of the radar, either in one or two player mode.</desc>

You fly in different locations, such as the Middle East, Alaska, the Pacific, etc. During flight, you can also turn off the music and play with only the flight sounds.

Your mission is to defeat a fixed number of enemies each mission. Your targets will always be aerial ones. You can shoot a cannon (which ammunition is unlimited) or missiles (8 per mission). If an enemy shoots you a missile, you can try to avoid it using the stealth mode (pressing the start button) once per mission. The stealth mode will automatically turn off once you pass out of the danger. If you manage to accomplish the mission perfectly, a bonus round is offered, and you have to try to take down as many enemies as you can.

The game can be played by one or two player taking turns. A second player can also take control of the aircraft closest to the center of the radar, either in one or two player mode.</desc>

The game features a turn-based combat viewed from 1st-Person in which only the current attacking/attacked enemy is visible. In Towns the characters can buy weapons (including energy based weapons which have a need to be recharged), items, protective gears, magics (called ESP), or treat their injuries (different body parts can take damage),.</desc>

	<desc>Save Professor Cinnamon!  When aliens from the planet Attackon kidnap the inventor during their invasion of Earth, two TwinBee Stinger jets (armed with boxing gloves) are unleashed to rescue Cinnamon before the aliens turn the Earth into a giant ball of cotton candy!  

In this vertical and horizontal scrolling shooter, blast away unusual creatures and even more bizarre bosses, while collecting power-ups and super weapons. By repeatedly shooting bells that come out of the clouds, these bells will change colors, each color giving a different ability. Getting shot down releases a ghost of Stinger, which can be recollected to gain the jet's powers back.

In the two-player mode, if TwinBee (cyan craft) and GwinBee (green craft) align their flights (one behind the other) they can turn their guns into a ripple laser. The Japanese version features a three players mode, with the addition of WinBee (the magenta craft, which was removed from the US version).</desc>

	<desc>The player is Ken, the hero of the Street Fighter series. It's been 25 years since he last participated in a fighting tournament. He has become a scientist and has developed a powerful medicine together with his friend Troy. But an unknown fiend breaks into his laboratory, kills Troy, and steals the invention. It's time to recall the good old days and to embark on a quest for revenge!

Despite the US title, the game has little to do with the Street Fighter or the Final Fight games. This is an action platformer in which the player navigates Ken around, trying to avoid or kill the enemies by shooting at them with ranged weapons, adjusting the direction of the shot, or kicking and punching them. Ken is very agile and can jump high and climb walls.

River City Ransom is a side-scrolling beat-em-up similar to Double Dragon. The player, or players, travel through the locations of River City, encountering various gangs along the way. Gang members can be defeated with punches and kicks, or beaten up with objects scattered around. Upon their defeat, gang members drop money which Alex and Ryan can spend in malls to buy items that restore health and improve their combat abilities. The main characters have RPG-like numerical stats that can be improved this way, and can also buy books to learn combat manoeuvres. To finish the game, the player(s) have to find and defeat all the bosses.</desc>

The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei's games, but instead of conquering a country, the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China.  You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles.  You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.</desc>

Gameplay consists of riding a skateboard through various obstacles and defeating enemies who try to hinder the player's progress.

Fishfall is a game where the player controls a hand trying to catch as many freefalling fish as possible and then throwing them upwards toward a moving basket in order to meet a quota.

4HIM: The Ride isn't a game per se, but a sing-a-long of a song by Christian pop band 4Him.</desc>

If they do this, you can kick their Arabian butt and knock them off the screen. If you manage to kick two or more enemies at once, something will hit you that will make you invincible for a few seconds.

It doesn't matter about the order in which you collect the pots. However, each pot has a different letter on it, and if you collect the pots in the order that they appear at the top-right of the screen, you will receive a whopping 5000 points. After you collect the pots, you move on to the next level.  There are four levels in each part (section), and each part has a theme to them. In Part 1, Level 1, for instance, you have to collect the letters that make up the word ANIMAL. In subsequent levels, you have to create words that are actual animals (HORSE, RABBIT, MONKEY). Also, if you take too long to complete the level, a red genie will emerge from one of the pots and will attack you.</desc>

	<desc>Rumor says that the legendary Black Onyx, an artifact that grants eternal youth and happiness to those who can find it, lies within the Black Tower near the town of Utsuro. You assemble a party of brave adventurers and venture into the tower, defeating monsters on your way to the great treasure.

The Black Onyx is the very first RPG made by a Japanese company. It is similar in gameplay to early Wizardry and Ultima games with killing monsters and exploring dungeons, with dark, realistic visuals. You create a party (up to five members) and explore a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on the way. You also meet adventurers whom you can convince to join your party. The combat engine is turn-based.

	<name>Super Chinese [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Kung-Fu masters Jacky and Lee (Lee and Loo in the arcade version) return to their kingdom from a long trip. They discover that in their absence, Princess Min-min has been kidnapped and the 10 treasures of the kingdom stolen. Jacky and Lee must fight their way into eight different castles in order to defeat the monsters and rescue the princess.

Chinese Hero is a top-down action game for one or two players, both playing on the same screen. Each ninja has the ability to move in any of four directions: up, down, left and right, as well as punch directly in front of them and do a "Moon Sault Kick" (which can be powered up to a "Miracle Kick") whereby they jump and somersault directly in front. Both punches and the Moon Sault Kick can harm enemies. Defeating a certain number of enemies on each level will open the doorway into the next level. Occasionally extra passages (named "Quick Passage Zone") can be found to take shortcuts through areas with stronger enemies. At times, defeated enemies will leave power-ups behind which either player can collect in order to increase their abilities temporarily. While power-ups are diverse, here are examples of some of the effects: weakening specific enemies, invincibility, increased attack, extra lives and the ability to use projectile attacks.

	<desc>Blu Boltar, lord of the Yoma clan has invaded Chinaland and captured the Emperor. Sending out a TV broadcast across the realm, Blu Boltar declares himself the ruler. Jack and Ryu are the ninja masters of Chinaland, training under their mentor at Mt. Epin. Having heard the news of the Emperor's capture they set out to defeat Blu Boltar and his Yoma Clan.

Little Ninja Brothers is the second game in the Super Chinese series and the first to be a role-playing game. Players, controlling either Jack or Ryu, explore the world map in an overhead view. Random encounters with monsters will give the option to flee or to fight. During combat, gameplay resembles the first Super Chinese game, where players move their character up, down, left and right... and can either punch or do a somersault jump to damage enemies. Additional power-ups, can also be found during the course of battles. Successfully defeating enemies awards experience points and Sen money. Jack and Ryu share experience points so they remain at the same level. A second player can join in at any time and share the experience level of the first player. Sen is the currency of the world and can be spent in the convenience store of each town to increase abilities and buy new weapons. Some of these include throwing stars, special martial arts techniques, swords, projectile attacks and other special powers. Towns also contain people who will give clues and information to Jack &amp; Ryu.

When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack &amp; Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.

Little Ninja Brothers also features a field meeting mode where Jack and Ryu compete in a variety of sports themed events themed around a foot race. The different modes available for this competition include: a regular Dash, Popping Baloons, Athletic Obstacle Course, Finding a treasure hidden inside rocks, Eating food attached to balloons and finally, Shooting targets with projectiles.</desc>

Control your team of six players to pummel the opposing team into submission using only the ball and your team's unique skills. Each player has his own special attacks and each team has their own unique attributes.

Play the World Cup mode and take on teams from around the world to claim the championship. You play as the star USA team and must work your way through teams from countries such as England, Iceland, Japan, and more to finally take on the current ruling world champions, the Soviet Union.

Or you can challenge a friend in Versus mode and go head to head with whatever teams you choose.

Or, if you just feel like cutting loose, you can play Bean Ball mode which is just a free-for-all every-man-for-himself romp in the school yard. Be the last man standing. You can play this alone or with a friend, but the computer will control the remaining 4-5 players.</desc>

	<name>Super Dyna'mix Badminton [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Radically different from other racquet sports such as tennis, badminton uses a high-drag shuttle which gives it an irregular path. In this video game adaptation, the player controls the Japanese player in a competition against five opponents: Canada, USA, UK, South Korea and China. Each match is played on best-of-five sets, played to 15 (boys) or 11 (girls) points. Four different courts can be chosen.

Along the d-pad, two buttons are used to control the player - one to swing the racquet, and other to jump. By following the shadow of the shuttle the player can position himself correctly, and then hit it in perfect timing, giving it enough power and lift to reach the opponent's side, and then (hopefully) descend out of the opponent's reach. Jumping allows the player to hit the shuttle downwards but still over the net, reducing the reaction time for a proper return drastically.</desc>

	<desc>A 3D style game inspired by ball-and-paddle games, such as Breakout. Super Glove Ball was designed exclusively for Mattel's Power Glove accessory. (Although it can still be played with a normal controller)

Your shuttle commander has been trapped in a dimensional maze in space, and you must use your glove to throw an energy ball at the walls in order to advance.

The walls in each maze room you encounter are filled with blocks. Using your Power Glove, you have to entirely break down a wall before being allowed to advance to the next room. 

While trying to progress through the maze, your character will be under attack by a range of creature, and a wizard who wants to mess with your work. The object for the player is to find the way out of the maze and rescue the Commander.</desc>

	<desc>Super Jeopardy! is based on the popular Jeopardy! TV game show. In this digital incarnation, 4 players compete at answering reverse trivia questions in trademark Jeopardy! fashion-- i.e., the host provides the answer and a player has to provide the questions. As many of 4 human players can participate, with the remaining slots filled by the computer. Competition takes place in quarter-final, semi-final, and final round modes.

A player will select a question from one of 6 categories. The game gives the answer to the question and the players use their controllers to buzz in. At that point, a player has 80 seconds to spell out the question (and the computer has already provided the "What is..." question preamble). In the player gets the question wrong, that player loses money and the remaining players have an opportunity to buzz in.</desc>

	<desc>The Princess has been kidnapped by the evil Bowser, and it is up to Mario and brother Luigi to save the day.

The first ever platform adventure for the Mario Brothers has the player exploring level after level, with Bowser to contend with as the end of level boss. Power-ups include the Super Mushroom, which increases Mario's size and power, the fire flower, allowing him to shoot fireballs at enemies, and the ever important starman for a short burst of invincibility.

Each level includes a bonus section filled with coins plus a shortcut through the level, plenty of bad buys and obstacles to get past, and an end of level flag, in which the higher the player grabs it, the more points are awarded to them. Certain levels also include warp points, which takes the player to higher levels.</desc>

	<name>Super Pitfall II [USA] (Proto)</name>
	<desc>In "Atlantis no Nazo", you play a nameless archaeologist who must descend into the dangerous caverns of the lost continent Atlantis, and eventually find his way to the inner sanctum with the legendary treasure. The game plays like a standard action-based platformer. The levels feature plenty of enemies and gaps you must jump over. Your only weapon are sticks of dynamite. When you throw a stick, it will bounce off the floor and explode only after a couple of seconds, so very precise aiming and timing are needed to defeat the enemies. Many levels contain optional treasure chests as well as hidden doors that lead to bonus levels. Sometimes level progression is non-linear, i.e. you can jump straight to a high-numbered zone if you find the correspondent door on the level. All the levels are timed. The protagonist dies when he falls into a pit, touches an enemy, or runs out of time.</desc>

	<desc>Super Spike V'Ball / Nintendo World Cup was a pack-in game included with the Nintendo Entertainment System Sports Set. The package included a standard NES console, four game controllers, and the Four Score Multiplayer Adapter. The cart included two games developed by Technos: # Super Spike V'Ball, a two-on-two beach volleyball game where you played on a tournament, ending with the world championship. The game supported up to four players on one match at a time; # Nintendo World Cup, a soccer game where you (and a friend) chose to represent a team and played several matches until you won the World Cup. The game featured little to no rules, which means that you could hit your opponents as much as you want, without fear of the referee getting in the way. Both games were compatible with the included Four Score NES multiplayer adapter.</desc>

	<desc>Super Team Games is a side scrolling game where two players compete in races on an obstacle course. The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</desc>

	<name>Super Turrican [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Like other entries in the series, Super Turrican for the NES is a side-scrolling platformer in which players explore large levels filled with enemies items and secret areas. Three different, upgradable weapons are available: multiple (spreadshot), laser and rebound. Holding down the fire button activates a rotatable laser that is useful for discovering hidden power-up capsules.

Despite carrying the same name as one of its big brothers, Super Turrican for the NES is based on Turrican and Turrican II. While some levels are very similar to those found in Turrican I and II (with only slight changes of layout and enemy types), others are entirely new. 

Apart from different/new level design, there are other notable changes: Holding down the fire button let's Turrican run, there is no time limit to levels anymore, energy wheel usage is limitless and the shield isn't time based anymore, but can sustain a certain number of hits.</desc>

	<desc>Super Xevious is a 2D shoot 'm up by Namco and is part of the Xevious series. Xevious is known as one of the hardest and fastest shooters around and Super Xevious is even harder and faster!

The enemies of the first Xevious game are back! But this time they are not alone. No, the brought some nasty friends with them!
It is your job, as a fighter pilot, to blast them away! Destroy everything in sight!

Some ground structures that must be destroyed are hidden and are called Sol Citadels. To locate these hidden structures you must keep an eye on the target-sight that will flash when it goes over the structures.

Super Xevious takes all the great elements of the original Xevious and has also some improvements.
Some examples of improvements are, for instance, the shield option and the upgrade option.
The shield protects you from immediately death if you got hit during an attack.
The upgrade option gives you the possibility to upgrade your bombs, lasers and shields.

	<name>Superstar Pro Wrestling [Japan]</name>
	<desc>WCW: World Championship Wrestling is an isometric  wrestling game of the National Wrestling Alliance. 
Players can choose to engage in one- or two-player matches as either 1vs1 solo bouts or 2vs2 tag-teams. Upon selecting a mode, players choose their characters from among twelve featured wrestlers from the NWA league. Licensed characters include: Rick Flair ("Nature Boy"), Sting, Lex Luger ("Total Package"), Mike Rotunda, Road Warrior Hawk, Road Warrior Animal, Steve Williams (""Dr. Death"), Kevin Sullivan ("Gamemaster"), Ricky Steamboat ("The Dragon"), Ric Steiner ("Dogface Gremlin"), Eddie Gilbert ("Hotstuff") and Michael P.S. Hayes. Each wrestler has unique abilities not shared by the other wrestlers, including finishing moves and rope toss.

Prior to a match, the player is presented with a menu of eight "moves", of which the player chooses four to assign to the points of the directional pad. Once the match starts, the player is only able to use the four moves selected and the rope toss to attack the opponent. Each wrestler can move up, down, left and right inside the wrestling ring, climb the turnstiles at each corner and throw opponents out of the ring (where they will be disqualified if outside for 20 seconds). Each wrestler has a high damage "finisher move" which can only be performed when they are standing in the middle of the ring and the opponent's stamina bar is low.

	<path>/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/nes/Sweet Home (Japan) (Beta).zip</path>
	<name>Sweet Home [Japan] (Beta)</name>
	<desc>"Sweet Home" follows the exploits of five members of
an investigation group: Kazuo, Akiko, Taro, Asuka, and Emi. The famous painter Mamiya Ichirou lived many years in a secluded mansion, and rumor says there are some valuable frescos to find inside. Our investigators decide to take some pictures of the frescos. However, upon entering the mansion, a ghost-like figure of Mamiya appears  and threatens them. After this, they find themselves trapped in the mansion. The heroes must now find a way out of the mansion, not forgetting the frescos they came there for, and the destiny of an earlier investigation group that has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

"Sweet Home" is perhaps the first known example of survival horror genre, created by the same company that later made the famous  Resident Evil. However, "Sweet Home" is also a console-style RPG: characters fight random monsters in turn-based battles, equip various weapons and level up. You can (and must) form different teams from the five available characters, both for battles and for solving puzzles. Each character has his (or her) own item-based skill: Taro can take pictures, Emi can unlock almost any door, Kazuo has a lighter, Akiko uses a vacuum cleaner to remove dust and other obstacles, and Asuka has medical kits.

The game was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

	<name>Swords And Serpents [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Deep in the dungeons lay the fabled ruby treasures.  Many brave souls have tried to recover them; all have failed.  Little did they know how futile their quests would be -- they met a horrible fate at the hands of a horrible serpent king.  Can your party of champions defeat the dragon and claim the ruby treasures? Or will you, too, be vanquished?

Swords and Serpents is a first-person, party-based CRPG in the tradition of Wizardry. Put together a team of 4 heroes (roll your own characters or simply use the pre-generated party) from three classes: warrior, thief, and magician.  A 16-level dungeon awaits you, full of weapons, armor, magic spells, and other valuable items.  Beware, though: an assortment of traditional fantasy beasts and villains awaits you!  

Teleporters and &amp;quot;zoom tubes&amp;quot; speed up your travels.  Temples provide safe havens for your party to restore health and mana. An auto-map feature helps the player keep track of what locations you have visited.  A password system allows you to save your progress as you travel deeper into the darkness.</desc>

The dragon is only vulnerable from the rear so you need to sneak up on your opponent to tag him. Be careful, though, that your opponent does not sneak up on you and do the same to you. In a one player game, it is you versus three computer controlled dragons. In a vs. mode game, it is you versus another player controlled dragon. In a double player game, it is you versus another player and three computer controlled dragons in a wild free-for-all.</desc>

	<desc>As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".</desc>

	<desc>In the South Pacific, Master Higgins lives peacefully wearing only a grass skirt and a cap. That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

	<name>Takahashi Meijin no Bouken Jima II [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In Adventure Island II: Aliens in Paradise the player takes the role of Master Higgins who has to save his cavegirl from aliens which also want to dominate the Earth. The basic gameplay elements are the same as in its predecessor Adventure Island: Master Higgins walks through the levels while fighting against various enemies. One hit results in his untimely death unless he carries one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero.

A big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don't have to be used instantly but can be saved for later: before every level the player can choose the power ups he wants to bring with him. There are overall eight worlds with different themes which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes there are different paths with other level and at the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a boss.

	<desc>Your girlfriend is once again kidnapped by aliens, and you have to rescue her, forcing your way through various levels.

The gameplay and the design haven't much changed since Adventure Island II: Aliens in Paradise: there is a world map, you can choose items before starting a level, the levels themselves are quite short (unlike Adventure Island, where each large level contained several stages). You perform standard "adventure island" activities: ride various types of dinosaurs, throw boomerangs at snails, birds, snakes, and skulls, collect grapes and apples, jump over stones, and of course, ride your old trusty skateboard.

	<desc>Based upon an anime of the same name, which features a cast of characters that includes Takahashi Meijin, the main character and hero of the Adventure Island series, as well as redesign of the honeygirl fairy known as Bug-tte Honey (pronounced Bugute). In the anime, Takahashi and Honey get into various adventures along with three ordinary school children from Earth. 
While the game draws inspiration from the anime (which itself drew inspiration from Adventure Island) the game does not necessarily follow any of the episodes of the show. Instead, the game consists of four stages. In the first stage, you control Bug-tte Honey, who has the ability to fly about the screen. At the end of the first stage, Honey rescues Takahashi by smashing the cage he is being held captive in. From that point forward, the player controls Takahashi (Called Master Higgins in the US/EU version)</desc>

	<desc>Based on the Disney cartoon Talespin. Baloo's airline cargo company, Higher for Hire, makes deliveries all around the world. The air pirates, lead by the daring Don Karnage have increased their attacks against air travel. In order to foil the plans of the pirates, Baloo trades in his normal plane for a "Mini Sea Duck", designed to fly more maneuverably.To get his cargo delivered on time, Baloo must fly over many dangerous areas, and also pick up any cargo stolen  or scattered by the air pirates. Eventually, the fortress of the air pirates themselves must be destroyed for air travel to remain safe and profitable.

Talespin is a side-scrolling shooter, moving left to right across the screen. The Mini-Seaduck can fire projectiles and switch direction, flying right-to-left while upside-down. The money you make from recovery of these cargo items can be used to purchase upgrades at the end of each level from Wildcat, the mechanic. Many strange boss creatures and devices will guard the final areas of most levels.

	<name>Tatakae! Chou Robot Seimeitai Transformers : Convoy no Nazo [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Probably the first game to be based on the Transformers toys, Convoy no nazo pits the player as Ultra Magnus, who must find out the secret of Convoy (known as Optimus Prime in most of the world). To find it out, Ultra Magnus must travel through a set of platform-style worlds and fight a range of bosses, ranging from the Megatron, through the combiner series to a flying Decepticon emblem(!).

Ultra Magnus starts out in robot mode, where he can jump far but his shots travel only halfway across the screen. Press down, and Magnus transforms into a trailer. In trailer mode, he can pass below the planes as well as shoot upwards. When a plane is shot down, it transforms into a robot, which must be killed with the forward-pointing shot. Later on, the game becomes more platform-oriented.</desc>

	<desc>The world is ruled by a vicious warlord named Achiless and his henchmen. You are Ryu, the master of martial arts and sword-fighting, who has decided that a confrontation with Achilles is in order to bring peace and order back to the world. Your character is equipped with both a sword (for offense) and a shield (for defense). You will go through six stages starting at a ruined city, each with two boss characters (in the middle and at the end). Some enemies are so powerful that you will die the instant you fail to block. You also have to race against time as well, which makes the game that much more difficult.</desc>

	<name>Tecmo Baseball [USA]</name>
	<desc>Tecmo Baseball is one of the many baseball games released for the Nintendo Entertainment Systems. There are five modes in Tecmo Baseball: One Player, Two Player, One Player Allstar, Two Player Allstar, and a watch mode. In One Player mode you pick from one of the fourteen teams and challenge each of the other teams. A password feature allows you to continue from where you left off. You also have the option of using the DH rule.

Gameplay is similar to the many other baseball released for the NES. The camera angle when batting or pitching is from behind the pitcher. The pitcher can pitch the ball high and low, as well as curve it. Tecmo Baseball includes digitized voices for the umpire.</desc>

	<name>Tecmo Bowl [Japan]</name>
	<desc>The most popular American football game to hit the NES console, Tecmo Bowl pits the player vs. the computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff action, or you can go head-to-head with a human opponent in action or coach mode.  There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for official NFL team logos or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has the NFLPA but not the NFL license.

The play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally.  Player graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team.  Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.

There are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen.  Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap.  A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.

There are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.</desc>

You can choose between four modes of play: Manual, which enables you to control an individual team; Coach, which turns the play calling (but not the actual playing) over to you; Computer, which gives all the controls to the computer; and Skip, where the results of a computer-played game are posted, without the game ever having taken place. The game also allows you to set the quarter's time from two minutes to 12 minutes.</desc>

	<desc>In Tecmo World Wrestling, you select from 10 fictional wrestlers and compete against the others for the coveted Tecmo World Wrestling Title. When your match begins you'll find you've got all the moves of the pros. You can run, climb to the top ropes, climb outside the ring, pick up your opponent, throw them over the ropes, pin them, and escape from a pin yourself. The wrestlers, such as "The British Star" Rex Beat and "The Technician" Dr. Guildo have a full assortment of professional wrestling moves and holds such as the Pile Driver, Shoulder Throw, Cobra Twist, as well as the ever-popular Slam the Guys Face Into the Metal Post maneuver. 

Before selected matches you'll be able to beef up you're wrestler's strength with three different exercises. The bottom portion of the screen is where the energetic announcer describes what is going on in the ring, move by move.</desc>

The game features the original 4 turtles from the previous games in the series, as well as other fighters.

The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Casey Jones, or even Shredder.

Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as "fireballs".

The game's modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to defeat the Shredder, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</desc>

The third game in the series is basically the same as the second. The story and the stages are different, of course, but it doesn't really matter. Choose your favourite turtle and kill as many Foot Clan soldiers as you can, fight the bosses and reach Shredder in a Double Dragon-styled game.

The graphics and gameplay were improved. And, if the choice of the turtle depended only on personal taste in the second game (as they were all the same, in different colors), in this third episode they gained individual special moves.

	<name>Tenchi o Kurau [Japan]</name>
	<desc>A role-playing game for the NES set within the Romance of the Three Kingdoms mythos that has spawned games on nearly every platform imaginable.  A party is formed by selecting up to five officers from a huge pool, many of whom would only join you after be bribed or defeated in combat.  Officers in turn each had a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Si Ma Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).  One of the first games on the NES to attempt to simulate large scale combat between different forces, although obviously in a very limited way.</desc>

	<name>Tenkaichi Bushi - Keru Naguuru [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Tenkaichi Bushi is a one-on-one martial arts fighting game set in ancient China.

Using 2D side-scrolling graphics with a distinct cartoony design, the player takes control of a single fighter as he attempts to defeat his opponent in single-round fights. Combat is controlled with a single attack button which can unleash all sorts of moves when pressed in conjunction with the directional arrows. These moves vary among each fighter, as players can choose from 15 different fighters, each with their own stats and moves, and then compete against the others to see who gets the honor of becoming grandmaster.

Additionally the game includes a story mode in which players can take control of a single martial artist and roam the countryside looking for challengers (the later done from a top-down map view). Starting abilities and health are minimal, but successfully defeating opponents will increase the player's health and allow the fighter to learn new moves and turn into the ultimate combatant.</desc>

The main levels of the game consist of side-scrolling jumping and shooting action.

The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

The game offers two different modes of play, "Type A" and "Type B". "Type A" is a standard endless mode, where the speed of the game increases every ten lines, with an option for the starting level when beginning the game. "Type B", on the other hand, is a race to clear 25 lines, with options for both drop speed and starting garbage. In both modes, successful play is rewarded with cute animations. There are also three different background songs to choose from.</desc>

"Type A" is a standard endless mode, where the speed of the game increases every ten lines, with an option for the starting level when beginning the game. "Type B", on the other hand, is a race to clear 25 lines, with options for both drop speed and starting garbage. In both modes, successful play is rewarded with cute animations. There are also three different background songs to choose from.</desc>

	<desc>This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, as well as the best-known (but not the only) version on Nintendo's first home console. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which disappear.

	<name>Tetris [USA] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>The drama surrounding Tetris is one of the most storied sagas in the history of the NES. Tengen, an ambitious Atari-associated game developer, began releasing official NES games in 1988. Meanwhile, the company worked rapidly behind the scenes to override Nintendo's infamous lockout device that kept unofficial cartridges from being played on its console. When Tengen released its first unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just the beginning of the Tengen/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely lacked. Today, the game known as Tengen Tetris is a rare title to have in your collection, but it's a worthwhile play. After all, Tetris is one of the classic games not only on the NES, but of all-time.</desc>

Each play field starts with different colored dots (in this case black, gray and white), with one of each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the same three colors, and by matching blocks of the same color over the top or to the side of the dot will clear the dot and those blocks from the screen.

	<name>Tetris 2 + Bombliss [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Tetris 2 + BomBliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game. There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.

Tetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.

BomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.

BomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.</desc>

You pilot a Battletech-style robot capable of switching from a 'mech into a jet at any time.  Your weapon auto-aims, but uses up a fixed amount of rechargable energy; if you run out of this energy, you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can fire again.  Your 'mech also contains a shield that can be activated to protect you from harm, but this lasts for a few seconds and uses up some of your life energy.</desc>

	<desc>A "Breakout" type game with interesting characters such as Mr. Chin and the Thunder Warrior.  Mr. Chin holds a stick over his head that acts as the paddle.  If your ball hits one of the power-up carriers (Flying Saucer, Submarine or Airplane) you have to try and pick up the released power-up while continuing to keep the ball in play.

Power-ups are:

1. Glove: Catch the ball and then release with the A button.
Long: Mr. Chin's stick will become longer.
1-Up: Get an extra life for Mr. Chin.
Missile: Gain fire power, press the A button to launch a missile, catch a second missile to fire two missiles simultaneously.
Big Ball: The ball enlarges and blows through any type of block in its path.
Slow: This will slow the speed of the ball.
3 Balls: The ball will split into three balls and as long as you keep one ball from falling you will always have three balls.
6 Balls: The ball will split into six balls.

"Bad Characters" will occasionally appear and try to mess with Mr. Chin.

1. Sea Anemone: If he captures your ball it will split into two smaller balls.
Octopus: He lives underwater inside an ancient vase, if the vase is hit by the ball the octopus will come out and try and latch onto Mr. Chin's stick.  If he succeeds he will weigh you down causing you to move slower.
Turtle: They will walk over the wall and transform themselves into new blocks to hinder your progress.
Bird: If hit with your ball it will fly out of control smashing through the walls before flying away.
Thunder Warrior: If you hit the Thunder Warrior with your ball he will release a circle of lightning bolts that will fly around him. The lightning bolts will destroy the walls but they will momentarily paralyze Mr. Chin if he is hit.</desc>

These 3 days will be subtracted from your overall 60 days you have to beat the entire game. 

Your enemies consists of such exotic fare as poisonous space scorpions, mutant sea worms and even environmental adversaries such as fire spitting volcanoes. By defeating certain enemies, you aircraft can gain powerups such as replenishing delpleted heath, increased firepower, or adding orbital ships to fly by the side of your main ship to assist you in combat.</desc>

The world powers have decided to initiate operation THUNDERCADE to stop AATOM. Equipped with a high-performance combat motorcycle, sidecar cannons, and backed by a precision B-7 bomber, you set out on the dangerous mission.

The player controls a motorcycle traveling through four distinct areas; the city, the base, the woodlands and the fortress which contains the final objective which is the nuclear power plant. The motorcycle shoots bullets and can be upgraded by finding powerups which add sidecars to the motorbike, which in turn adds more firepower. Also, you can call in a limited amount of airstrikes  to help you clear the screen of enemy tanks and troops.</desc>

	<desc>Tiger Heli is the name of your helicopter, according to the box the result of a billion-dollar defense project and forged from ebony metal and glistening chrome. Your goal is to defeat the country of Cantun, which is run by terrorists and has become completely power hungry with an aim to take over the whole world.

You're shooting tanks, ships, aircraft carriers and trains while flying towards the impenetrable military base. You shoot crates to get pickups. If you shoot the crate when it is green you get a bomb pickup, if you shoot it when it is red you get a mini helicopter that attaches to one of your sides shooting sideways, and if you shoot it when it is white you get a mini helicopter shooting forward. If you shoot 10 crates with a yellow diamond shape you get an extra life.</desc>

	<name>Tiles of Fate [USA] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>In Tiles Of Fate the object of the game is to clear the screen of all the tiles within the given time limit. This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges!</desc>

	<desc>Oh, no! On the way to meet your girlfriend Haruka, our intrepid little hero has gotten ambushed by that nefarious, time-traveling villain, Professor Time. Now it's time to join him as he crosses time and space to save her from his evil clutches.

In this run and jump action game, you'll find yourself flung anywhere from prehistoric times to the far future and back again, defeating anything from dinosaurs to samurai to aliens just to get her back.

Your main weapon  your ever-sturdy baseball cap. Just toss it forward and let it simply boomerang back or jump as it boomerangs back to let it fly around you for a short amount of time. And if you're lucky enough to collect enough chimes, you'll get to witness the awesome destructive power and invincibility of the skateboard.

Combined that with a host of hazardous obstacles so prevalent in platformers and you've got yourself into quite a pickle trying to tackle Professor Time. Pursue and flog him with your cap so that the hero and Haruka can live happily ever after.</desc>

	<desc>In the year 2050 the Earth has been attacked by the villainous Raggosians and it is your job to save the planet! You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.</desc>

	<name>Tokoro San no Mamoru mo Semeru mo [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Featuring Japanese celebrity "Tokoro-san" as its protagonist, this is a run-of-the-mill jump and run game. In order to save a baby, Tokoro-san must traverse Tokyo, armed only with a water pistol. Cute nasties which look like fantasy creatures run at him and must be shot down. Others come out of holes in the ground beneath collapsing platforms, and certain monsters will, when shot, run away from Tokoro-san and run down all monsters in their path. Shooting the pistol will use up the water reserve, which will decrease the range of the shots. Leaving enemies alone when possible is therefor a good strategy. When Tokoro-san enters a house, a boss battle must be run through before he can choose a path to other districts in the town. When the player is hit too many times by monsters, or the water pistol runs out of water, the game is over.</desc>

Tom has mouse-napped Jerry's nephew Tuffy and locked him in a trunk in the attic. You and your furry little buddy Jerry must dash, jump, and climb from the basement up through every level of the house to rescue him in time.

Jerry's main defense is his unlimited supply of marbles. Pick up other items such as bubble gum, meat cleaver, cups of water, moth balls, hammer, invisible ink and drill to overcome the enemies and obstacles in your way. Make sure you outwit Tom whenever he appears.

Look for cheese power-ups and mouse hole bonus stages along the way.

Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.</desc>

	<desc>Just like in the first game, you fly an F-14 Tomcat in combat against the enemy equipped with Soviet equipment, although there is no direct reference to the Soviet Union anywhere. The only plot of this game is to destroy everything you see, excluding the aircraft carrier to which you must land at the end of each level.

In addition to the basic game mode with anti-ship, ground attack and space battle levels, similar to the first game, the second mission adds two extra modes. In the first extra mode you can fight against top enemy aces flying a MiG-25 Foxbat, one at a time. The second extra mode is two-player game with split screen, in which you can fight against your friend, both flying Tomcats.

You will have to fight against interesting level bosses such as a giant Tu-160 Blackjack bomber, a Mi-24 Hind attack chopper and an armed space shuttle.

Another interesting detail about the game is that between fighting the aircraft and surface opponents you have to dodge between giant trees (yes, you read correctly!!), lightnings and laser attacks.

	<name>Top Gun [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Top Gun is loosely based on the film of the same name. It is an action game in which the player controls an F-14 Tomcat fighter through four different missions.

The action is seen from a first-person cockpit view. Depending on the mission, different kinds of targets must be destroyed. There are always enemy aircraft, but some missions include sea and ground targets as well. Two weapons are available: machine guns (with unlimited ammunition) and missiles. The player can choose from three types of missiles before a mission: the more powerful ones can only be carried in lower quantities.

Enemy aircraft either overshoot the players's plane from behind and can be easily taken down, or they come from the front and fire guns and missiles. Sometimes, an enemy plane will position itself on the player's six. It should be lost quickly by steering left and right, or instant death follows.

Halfway through missions two through four comes a refueling sequence where the fuel plane's nozzle must be aligned with one's aircraft.

Every mission (except the first one) features a final mission target, which can take a lot more damage than regular targets.

Each mission concludes with a landing attempt on the aircraft carrier. To successfully land, the player's plane must have a certain altitude and speed. Successfully landing gives bonus points, but crashing the plane doesn't end the game - it simply costs a life.</desc>

	<desc>Top Gun is loosely based on the film of the same name. It is an action game in which the player controls an F-14 Tomcat fighter through four different missions.

The action is seen from a first-person cockpit view. Depending on the mission, different kinds of targets must be destroyed. There are always enemy aircraft, but some missions include sea and ground targets as well. Two weapons are available: machine guns (with unlimited ammunition) and missiles. The player can choose from three types of missiles before a mission: the more powerful ones can only be carried in lower quantities.

Enemy aircraft either overshoot the players's plane from behind and can be easily taken down, or they come from the front and fire guns and missiles. Sometimes, an enemy plane will position itself on the player's six. It should be lost quickly by steering left and right, or instant death follows.

Halfway through missions two through four comes a refueling sequence where the fuel plane's nozzle must be aligned with one's aircraft.

Every mission (except the first one) features a final mission target, which can take a lot more damage than regular targets.

Each mission concludes with a landing attempt on the aircraft carrier. To successfully land, the player's plane must have a certain altitude and speed. Successfully landing gives bonus points, but crashing the plane doesn't end the game - it simply costs a life.</desc>

	<name>Total Recall [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Based on the 1990 Schwarzenegger film of the same name, Total Recall for the NES generally adheres to the movie's plot across its nine levels. Unlike the various PC iterations, this title was created by Interplay and published by Acclaim.

Players control Doug Quaid as he platform hops across Earth and Mars in search of his stolen memories and the responsible parties. A collection of police, soldiers, and creatures will try to stop him. Quaid's default attack is a strong punch, though guns can be knocked away from some guards and picked up for use. Cutscenes between certain levels tell the movie's plot, and feature likenesses of the actors from the film (including Arnold).

Sequences in the film are also replicated more tightly than in the PC versions. Quaid will be chased by henchman Richter in the first level, and must battle his wife inside their apartment. The security x-ray scanner takes up a level, as does the subway battle after. The player will also commandeer a Martian taxi for a driving level inside the colony, and windows can be shot out on Mars, sucking out any unfortunate baddies nearby.</desc>

	<name>Totally Rad [Europe]</name>
	<desc>Totally Rad is an action-adventure game in which you play Jake, a magician wannabe being trained by the Master Magician Zebediah. One day, during his training, Jake is attacked by surprise by unknown foes who kidnap Allison, his girlfriend. Then, Jake has to save her and discover what lies behind that attack.

This game is a side-scrolling one, with the basic controls common to many of those games that fall in the same category: moving, jumping and shooting. Your basic weapon is something like an energy ball that can be charged by holding the button for a few seconds until its maximum power. Although Jake is supposed to still be learning his magic from Zebediah, from the very beginning you can use all his magical powers. You can select which magic you want to use from a list, displayed when you press the start button. The magical powers available include healing, time stopping, invincibility, the power of the elements (fire, watter, wind and earth) and 3 different metamorphosis. You can morph into a flying guy who throws something like a boomerang (that doesn't come back), a fish-like guy, who throws something like ninja stars and can swim, and a feline-like guy, who releases electrical shocks from his hands and becomes invincible while jumping. You do not evolve during the game, as your health and magic bar doesn't grow.

Totally Rad, as the name points out, is a game full of slang, with the constant use of words like totally, gnarly, dude, excellent, decent, righteous, etc.</desc>

There are 12 teams from NFL cities to play with (six East, six West), although there is no NFL license and no real NFL players.  Offensive plays can be run from five basic formations: long pass, short pass, quarterback sneak, running backs, and field goal kick/punt.  There are no formations or plays on defense, but there are two possible players (A or B button) to take control of before the snap.  The player perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling.  Standard football scoring rules: most points after four quarters wins!</desc>

	<desc>You wake up in the middle of a forest. Your head hurts. You don't remember anything: you don't know who you are, and you vaguely recall your name. A man approaches you and says his name is Darus. After realizing that you are suffering from a strange amnesia, Darus takes you to a nearby village and soon reveals to you that he is a sorcerer on a quest for revenge. You join forces, and soon become involved in a complex mystery of a kidnapped princess, the destruction of the world, and search for your own identity...

Radia Senki is set in a semi-modern, semi-medieval environment, and introduces an unusual blend between action and strategic RPG. During the pre-set (not random) battles, your party and the enemies can freely move around the battle screen. You control the main character by attacking in real time, but you can pause at any time and give a command to other party members: attack a specified enemy, be offensive in general, use a healing or other technique, pretend to be dead, etc.</desc>

	<desc>In order to restore his immortal powers, Wazula, an evil Kahuna, is ordered to travel to Hawaii to kidnap Barbi Bikini. Barbi Bikini happens to be Thrilla Gorilla's girlfriend so now he's off to Africa so he can rescue her.

The game features 7 worlds each containing 5 stages (except for the 1st and 3rd world where each contain only 4 stages). Most of the game involves controlling Thrilla on a skateboard, dodging or jumping over various obstacles and enemies while attempting to get to the end of the stage. There will also be times when Thrilla will get to be on a surfboard, but gameplay remains the same as it was on the skateboard. Thrilla also rides a shark underwater with the goal still being to get to the end of the stage while either dodging enemies or throwing spears at them. There are also boss battles where Thrilla throws either coconuts or spears trying to deplete all the health of his adversary. 

There is also a shell game between stages which allows the player to obtain extra lives. The game also contains powerups throughout its levels such as a banana which restores health.</desc>

	<desc>T&amp;C Surf Designs features both skateboarding and surfing games. The skating section (called Street Skate Session) is a side scrolling action game where you need to navigate through an obstacle course within the given time limit. Ideally you want to earn as many points as possible by performing tricks, jumping over items, and collecting bonuses. If you crash too many times (or fall into a hole, run out of time, etc...) then the game will be over. In the surfing section (called Big Wave Encounter) you need to surf a giant wave all the way to the beach. As with skating, you can earn points by performing tricks and collecting bonuses; likewise the game ends if you crash too many times. You can choose to play either game individually, or alternate between the two (the Wood &amp; Water Rage option). You can select several T&amp;C Surf Designs characters to play as, including Thrilla Gorilla, Kool Kat, Joe Cool, and Tiki Man.</desc>

	<desc>Based on Troma's cartoon series of the same name,  the Toxic Crusaders protect the city of Tromaville against the plots of the alien Dr. Killemoff and his Radiation Rangers. That is, until Killemoff captures all of the Toxic Crusaders save one. As Toxie, you must "mop up" Killemoff's forces through 6 levels and rescue his comrades before it's too late.

The game is action-oriented. Toxie's only abilities are to jump and to punch his way through enemies. He initially starts with a mop weapon, which can be easily lost.</desc>

	<desc>Track &amp; Field is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. It is based on an arcade game of the same name. Events include 100 meter dash, hammer throw, the long jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The NES version adds skeet shooting, triple jump, javelin throw, high jump, and archery as events but loses the hammer throw event. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If you want to go to the next event or round then you will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

	<desc>Samantha and Norbert, two teenage troll twins, were windsurfing one day and came upon an undiscovered and uncharted island. They recalled that once long ago their grandfather had told them of an island that contained lost treasures. So the twin trolls decide to explore the island to see if they can obtain these treasures.

Trolls on Treasure Island involves the same type of gameplay found in Dudes with Attitude. In this puzzle game, the player controls one of the trolls as they bounce back and forth across the screen trying to acquire the jewels on the playfield. The one caveat is that the players troll has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, the player has to bounce across a paint can that will change your trolls hair to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time.

The game offers 32 levels to navigate through and the player is also able to create their own level with the custom level editor.

This is an unlicensed NES game.</desc>

	<desc>Twin Eagle is a vertically scrolling arcade style shooter. You control a helicopter, and need to earn points by shooting or bombing the various (and numerous!) enemies you'll encounter. Planes, helicopters, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, foot soldiers, and more will all be trying to bring your mission to an abrupt end! Occasionally, you may find hostages when a building is destroyed; try to rescue as many of the hostages as you can to earn extra points. Your helicopter has the ability to pick up extra weapons. After destroying certain enemies, a power up will be left behind which can give you one of four different types of firepower (the regular machine gun, canon, two way fire, or missiles). Other power ups that can be found include bombs (which can be used to destroy everything on the screen), extra speed, and weapon power up (increases the capabilities of whatever type of weapon you currently have).</desc>

	<name>Twin Eagle [USA]</name>
	<desc>Twin Eagle is a vertically scrolling arcade style shooter. You control a helicopter, and need to earn points by shooting or bombing the various (and numerous!) enemies you'll encounter. Planes, helicopters, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, foot soldiers, and more will all be trying to bring your mission to an abrupt end! Occasionally, you may find hostages when a building is destroyed; try to rescue as many of the hostages as you can to earn extra points. Your helicopter has the ability to pick up extra weapons. After destroying certain enemies, a power up will be left behind which can give you one of four different types of firepower (the regular machine gun, canon, two way fire, or missiles). Other power ups that can be found include bombs (which can be used to destroy everything on the screen), extra speed, and weapon power up (increases the capabilities of whatever type of weapon you currently have).</desc>

	<name>TwinBee [Japan]</name>
	<desc>TwinBee is a vertical scrolling shooter. The players control cartoon-like spacecrafts with anthropomorphic arms, player one being TwinBee and player two being WinBee. The spacecrafts can be moved in all 8 directions, with one button for regular shooting flying enemies and one button for dropping ground bombs.

Power-ups in the form of bells can be collected by shooting clouds. The color of the bell will change if it is shot by the player, assuming one of the possible colors:

1. Yellow: grants bonus points;
2. White: upgrades player's guns to a twin cannon;
3. Blue: increases player's speed (up to five levels);
4. Green: creates image copies of the craft for more firepower;
5. Red: provides a shield to sustain damage.

The green and red bells cannot be combined. Alternate power ups can be collected from the ground, such as an alternate bell which upgrades the craft with a three way gun and a star which destroys all enemies on screen.

One shot in the middle section of the craft will destroy it. Shots which hit one of the craft's arms will destroy only the arm. If both arms are lost, the craft won't be able to shoot bombs anymore and will have to be repaired by an ambulance.

In the two-player mode, TwinBee (cyan craft) and WinBee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join "hand-to-hand" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots.</desc>

	<desc>Third game in the Twinbee series of vertically-scrolling surreal cute 'em ups. Once again you take the role of either Twinbee or Winbee (Gwinbee having been kidnapped by the final boss) as they fly through the fantasy kingdom shooting the hell out of their... uhm... enemies, or whatever they are.

As in other games in the series you can gain power-ups after defeating certain amounts of enemies by shooting the magical bells they leave behind, depending on the amount of times you shoot them, they change color and thus give different power-ups such as multiple shots, options, etc.

If correctly powered-up both ships can join-up to perform a screen-clearing attack, and you can choose your starting stage from any of the first four stages (the fifth and last remaining locked until you clear all the others).

	<desc>Space Defence Force SDF is a vertically scrolling space shooter. Though it scrolls vertically, you are granted some movement horizontal movement as well. The action isn't frantic, but the game is still somewhat difficult due to tight enemy attack waves and the possibility of being shot in the back. For this reason, you should not let enemies pass unscathed, since they may shoot back at you from off-screen. At some points, power up capsules will materialize in space. They will grant you not only greater firepower, but also serve as a reconfigurable armor, which is SDF's main selling point. The armor may be moved from your front to your back, and while it is moved in a large arc, it will destroy any enemies it happens to ram. When fastened to your rear, it will also grant a small speed boost. Learning to use the armor is the key to surviving in this game.</desc>

	<name>Uchuusen - Cosmo Carrier [Japan]</name>
	<desc>It is the year 1999. Invading aliens are slowly forcing our orbiting moon towards Earth. In one hundred hours all life on Earth will be destroyed. Your mission is to travel from planet to planet in our solar system and intercept the alien fleet.

Uchuusen: Cosmo Carrier is an action strategy game where you pilot the titular Cosmo Carrier and combat aliens while gaining intelligence on the solar system, the planets and its moons. Information you gather from satellites with your deployable Mechs will help you find the alien force and destroy them. Once deployed your Mechs walk around the surface and fight turrets and find items/clues.

Your viewscreen is where you target alien space-craft, astronauts, moons, and planets and interact with them. The interactions allowed are:  Missile, Beam, Shiled(SIC), Move, Communicate, Computer, Parts, and State. Missile launches a rocket with adjustable strength at your target. Beam shoots a laser weapon at your target. The misspelled Shield function lets you decide if you want your shields on or not. Move button has two different sub selections; Warp and Land. Warp lets you travel from planet to planet while Land lets you deploy one of your Mechs on to the surface of a satellite or enemy cruiser. Communicate lets you do just that, communicate with planets and other vehicles. Computer gives you read-outs on targeted planets and vehicles. The Computer also is where you perform repairs on your ship or Mechs. Parts lets you see what weapons you have loaded. Finally, State, gives you detailed information pertaining to shields, weapons etc of your Cosmo Carrier and three Mechs; Gravity, Blizzard and Field.</desc>

	<desc>The NintendoAge community was able to rise enough money to obtain and share a rom of the cancelled NES game ?U-Force Power Games?. In this multicart, you'll be able to experience the only games designed specifically for the U-Force controller. Included are the games Hose 'Em Down, Nuclear Rat Attack, Rock on Air, and Power Field B-Ball. 
In Hose 'Em Down you are in charge of a fire hose in front of a burning building. As people appear at the windows you must slowly lower them with your water blast. Go too slow and they burn to death!
Pink mutant rats are attacking your reactor in Nuclear Rat Attack. If you don't kill them fast enough they fry and meltdown the system! 
Rock on Air turns your U-Force into a theremin and lets you create music. Wave your hands around so your friends think you are crazy!
Think sports games where you just hit a button are too easy? Power Field B-Ball challenges you by having no buttons! Added two player mode with one U-Force controller ensures the hilarity doesn't stop. 
Much more than a reproduction, this original game cartridge is built using all new parts. No donor carts were harmed in the making of this game.</desc>

	<desc>Ufouria is a (side scrolling) platform adventure video game. You begin play as Hebereke (Bop Louie in PAL regions), a penguin (though in PAL release he is more humanoid and looks like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man), and must explore the world on which you and three other friends crash landed. As you encounter the new characters you must fight them to make them recover their memory.  Once you have recovered all 3 other characters you are then searching for Temple Keys which will lead back to your homeworld of Ufouria.

The world in which you interact is free form, meaning that you can wander around as you please. To get to new areas you will need to get power-ups and/or new characters with their own abilities. Character switching is done as needed, not defined by levels.  Sections of the game have bosses and mini-bosses which include the characters which have not had their memory returned yet.

Many actions are expanded, including much more world interactivity and much deeper characters than the 'signpost' NPCs of Ultima IV.

In Ultima V, you, the Avatar and Hero of Britannia, are called back to deal with a new threat - the tyrant Blackthorn, who, after the disappearance of Lord British, now rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. Behind Blackthorn are the Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three Principles. Their meaning and origin are explored later in the game, rounding out an immersive world and very meaningful plot.

	<name>Ultimate League Soccer [Italy] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>In this soccer game, two players can play a single match between any of the 8 teams available, or one player can play either one of the two championships available.

The Ultimate League Soccer championship let the player choose one of 8 national teams: France, England, United States, Argentina, Italy, Brazil, Australia or Germany. The other championship available restricts the choice to the 4 first teams: France, England, United States and Argentina. Each national team has its own characteristics, varying in offensive, defense, speed, skill, accuracy and experience traits.

After selecting the team, players are prompted to choose the color of their team's uniform, among white, green, gray and red. They are also prompted to choose the duration of the periods (15, 30 or 45 minutes - which run faster than real time). They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.

The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective. While conducting the ball layers can make short passes (with button B) or strong kicks (with button A, stronger the longer the button is held). Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.

Players can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.</desc>

	<name>The Ultimate Stuntman [USA] (Unl)</name>
	<desc>Dr. Evil has kidnapped the scientist Jenny Aykroyd and it's the Ultimate Stuntman's job to rescue her.

Ultimate Stuntman must fight through 7 worlds with 4 stages each and then through the final world which consists of 3 stages. The game has a variety of different gameplay types. The stages go in the order of an overhead view stage, a side-scrolling stage, a climbing stage with the Android boss, and then a bomb disposal stage.

The overhead view stages deal with you driving either a car, boat, glider, or a dune buggy and trying to get to the end before time runs out on the clock. You must do this while either dodging or shooting enemies. In all the stages besides the one where you're given a glider you can use a limited number of turbo boosts to speed up your vehicle. In the glider stages you can alter your altitude to either go high above or below various obstacles. All of these levels end with a boss battle.

Sometimes after these stages there is a bonus round where you try to collect extras in a limited amount of time without crashing into any obstacles. Completing this successfully will yield an extra life.

The side-scrolling stages consists of two different experiences. One is a platformer where you walk around and can shoot enemies while searching for a set number of keys to unlock a forcefield at the end of the stage. The other consists of you flying a glider throughout a stage shooting enemies and trying not to crash until you get to the end of the stage.

The climbing stages consist of you climbing a building and shooting enemies with a reticle that you can move all over the screen.You have to get to the top of the building before time runs out. Once at the top you will have to fight an android boss. Such as Mega Slug, Techno Beast, and the Sand Yeti. The android boss fights take place on the buildings rooftops with a side view of the action. The player must drain the energy from the androids by repeated shooting bullets into them.

In the bomb disposal stage you must dispose of a bomb before the fuse burns all the way detonating it. You dispose the bomb by unsoldering chips away from each other. The player must use the directional pad to move the cursor from chip to chip keeping an eye on the number on each one. Every time the cursor moves to a certain block, the number on it decreases by one. This creates a puzzle-like scenario, where if the player makes a mistake he must reset the disposal and try again with less time.</desc>

	<desc>Professor Xavier and his Uncanny X-Men are all that stand in the way of the rampage of Magneto and his henchmen. The X-Men: Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Iceman and Nightcrawler, are ready to fight Magneto.

The Uncanny X-Men is an over-head view action game. Players begin by choosing two X-Men from the roster (the second either controlled by another player or the computer) and select one of five levels including a practice level. The goal in each level is to reach the hidden 'command center' and destroy it. The X-Men all share similar abilities, being able to move in any direction, jump and attack. Half of the characters (Storm, Iceman, Cyclops) have long range attacks while the other half (Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus) must get in close range to punch the enemies. Each X-men can only sustain a certain number of hits before being defeated. Should the two X-Men both fall in battle, players will be able to choose two more to attempt the level again until all of the X-Men are used up.

Power-ups include an "S" which stops time, invincibility for a short time and a health restore. There is also a Magnet (symbol of Magneto) power-down which renders the X-men immobile for a short time.</desc>

The game features 7 levels of action named The Street, The Warehouse, The Bridge, The Alleys, The Train station, The Hostage, and The Rooftop.

Other levels pit you against the gangsters in a first person shooter-style of gameplay where your character begins behind a wall, wraps around into an open area, and must take out the bad guys. When your character runs out of ammo, he slips back behind the wall to reload. These levels are accompanied with time limits and goals for the number of enemies you must kill.</desc>

Also, everyone is to look innocent should the police drive by.

This is a very early and simplistic fighting game. As mentioned, each player can only punch the other, trying to knock them off the screen and towards one of the waiting manholes.</desc>

	<name>USA Ice Hockey in FC [Japan]</name>
	<desc>This hockey game includes 24 NHL teams and 288 NHLPA players. The NES version contains an exhibition, training and a super cup mode. The SNES version has a practice and a season mode. The training mode in the NES version allows you to practice both offense and defense. The training mode in the SNES version lets you either practice in an exhibition game or compete in a shootout. The super cup is based on the round-robin format in the NES version. The teams chosen to compete in the super cup are decided by the teams rankings from the season mode in the SNES version.

The game is played with a top down view of the hockey rink, with the screen scrolling vertically as the puck carrier heads towards a net.</desc>

	<name>Ushio to Tora - Shinen no Daiyou [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Based on the animé series Ushio &amp; Tora, this game tells the story of a boy named Ushio. He lives in a modern-day Tokyo with his father, but his family line stretches back to the samurai days of Japan. Five hundred years ago a demon was terrorizing the land. Ushio's ancestor, wielding a magical spear from China, managed to bind the monster to a rock with an artifact. Unable to kill the demon, he built a temple around it and stayed there as a monk in order to make sure it won't escape. Ushio finds the demon still tied to the rock in the basement of one of the temple buildings. Unfortunately, by breaking the seal on the doors to the basement, Ushio has released the demon's evil energy, which attracts other monsters. Ushio calls the demon Tora, because it reminds him of a tiger (Tora is Japanese for tiger). Tora has to stick with Ushio, because he holds the magical spear, and to help him to defeat his own evil will!

The game plays like a traditional console-style RPG, with turn-based battles, where Ushio uses his family magic, and Tora his demonic abilities. You explore Tokyo by moving Ushio around from top-down perspective, and inside houses and dungeons the view switches to first-person, like in early "interactive fiction" adventures.

Ushio to Tora: Shinen no Daiyo is a Japan-only release and is not the same game as the SNES action title "Ushio &amp; Tora".</desc>

	<desc>A Zelda clone action-RPG hybrid which stars you as a Valkyrie that sets out to rid the magical lands of Valhalla from evil and recover the magic key of time, stolen by a mad god.

Gameplay follows the same top-down action-RPG rules as Zelda, with added niceties such as a life bar for most enemies and different stat upgrades when leveling up depending on your choice of star sign and blood group. You can purchase weapons and equipment to make your life easier (and solve some of the puzzles in the game which require specific items) but most of the game revolves around exploring the game world and slashing as many baddies as you can.

The game does look like a typical strategy game, in which the player moves all units per turn, until a character enters close combat (by moving unto the enemy). Here the character rides on a bike and tries to shoot a set number of enemies within 1 minute while trying to not being hit. For each hit the character receive experience and eventually level ups.</desc>

	<name>Vice : Project Doom [USA]</name>
	<desc>Quinn Hart and his partner, Detective Reese of the VICE squad both work to stop the trafficking of illegal substances. But something new has appeared on the scene, a neon gel with great addictive properties. During investigations as to the origin of the gel, Reese mysteriously disappears and leaves Hart without a lead. Time passes and Hart becomes romantically involved with his new partner, Christy, as he continues trying to track down the gel. But Hart is about to get a brand new lead...

Vice: Project Doom is a game that features both overhead driving modes and side-scrolling platform adventure sequences. Hart's vehicle can accelerate or slow down and fire his weapon straight ahead. During side-scrolling sequences, Hart can jump, duck, climb or use his selected weapon. Weapons that can be selected include a Katana sword, a pistol and a grenade-type weapon. These weapons feature limited ammunition with the exception of the katana. Power-ups include ammunition, coins, and health.

During both of these sequences, Hart must fight and maneuver his way past enemy foes to confront a boss. By destroying the boss and completing the level, Hart progresses and learns a bit more about the origins of the neon gel and what Project Doom is all about. Cinematics dialog between the levels tell the tale in a style similar to that of Ninja Gaiden.

There are 3 sub-levels on each station, which can be played in any order. The action scrolls in every direction, with you guiding your tank-link droid around to shoot the opposition droids. The tank takes a while to steer, making it initially harder to avoid contact with those enemies. Each level contains energy stars, which can be traded in for upgrades such as improved weapons and extra speed after each level.</desc>

In this game, the player takes control of Muttley, the grumbling, but loyal dog from the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon. His master Dastardly sends his on three different missions, each taking place in a different location, which in its turn is divided into smaller levels. 

Muttley has to complete those levels in a rather standard platformer fashion, moving from left to right, jumping, overcoming obstacles and fighting various creatures and boss enemies from the cartoon movie. The dog's primary weapon is, unsurprisingly, his own mouth - biting regular enemies will usually lead to their instant death. Muttley can also collect bones scattered across the levels, which will grant him powerful weapons and skills of limited use, such as a bomb, a projectile attack, and the ability to heal.</desc>

	<desc>Your distant uncle has passed away, leaving you, his heir, with a fortune of billions of dollars. The catch? The Benedict family has extremely high standards, and you have to prove that you can make that fortune even larger on the stock market before it will be given to you. In addition, you must exercise regularly to stay healthy, and keep your girlfriend happy by pampering her frequently with gifts. 

The game features a stock trading engine that is fairly simple to jump into. Buy stocks as you see fit, and finish the day. The next morning, you will find out whether your assets grew or not. If they didn't, you most likely need to invest in something else.</desc>

	<desc>Panic Restaurant is a side-scrolling platform game where you play as chef Cookie. The rival chef Ohdove has taken over his restaurant and it's up to Cookie to reclaim it.

It is a fairly basic platform game. You run and jump, and enemies are placed all around to try and stop you. The entire game, backgrounds, enemies and bosses, is food-themed. You encounter things such as sausages, microwave ovens, onions and hamburgers on your way through the restaurant. To your help you always have a frying pan to beat the enemies with, and you can also find other items, such as a spoon, and plates to throw at the enemies.

The game contains 6 stages, each in a separate location in the restaurant, such as the kitchen, freezer and basement. At the end of each level you are faced with a boss. In between each level is a bonus game where you play a slot machine to try and win some extra health and lives.</desc>

	<name>Wario no Mori [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Wario's Woods is a puzzle game similar to Tetris or Columns, but with a twist. Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.
There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.

There are 5 different modes of play: a "Round Game" in which Toad has to clear numerous levels, a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a two player mode, a "Time Race" mode, and finally, an extensive training mode.

There are some differences between the SNES and NES versions. Due to a lack of buttons, controls are a little different in the NES version (although all the moves from the SNES version are present). Also, there is no vs. mode against the computer, but the "Round Game" mode features two modes of play: one that includes boss-fights on every level ending with a 9.</desc>

Players can choose to engage in one- or two-player matches as either 1vs1 solo bouts or 2vs2 tag-teams. Upon selecting a mode, players choose their characters from among twelve featured wrestlers from the NWA league. Licensed characters include: Rick Flair ("Nature Boy"), Sting, Lex Luger ("Total Package"), Mike Rotunda, Road Warrior Hawk, Road Warrior Animal, Steve Williams (""Dr. Death"), Kevin Sullivan ("Gamemaster"), Ricky Steamboat ("The Dragon"), Ric Steiner ("Dogface Gremlin"), Eddie Gilbert ("Hotstuff") and Michael P.S. Hayes. Each wrestler has unique abilities not shared by the other wrestlers, including finishing moves and rope toss.

Prior to a match, the player is presented with a menu of eight "moves", of which the player chooses four to assign to the points of the directional pad. Once the match starts, the player is only able to use the four moves selected and the rope toss to attack the opponent. Each wrestler can move up, down, left and right inside the wrestling ring, climb the turnstiles at each corner and throw opponents out of the ring (where they will be disqualified if outside for 20 seconds). Each wrestler has a high damage "finisher move" which can only be performed when they are standing in the middle of the ring and the opponent's stamina bar is low.

	<name>Werewolf: The Last Warrior [Europe]</name>
	<desc>An evil leader and his gang of bio-engineered monsters has taken over the land and only one man stands in their way. Only he's not a man, he is a lycanthrope, a person able to transform into a terrible werewolf to let loose his anger.

You start the game in human form. The human can punch, jump, move and shoot a powered up shot which moves horizontally across the screen.  By finding a Red "W" icon, the human is able to transform into a mighty werewolf creature. Accidentally grabbing a blue "W" icon or losing too much energy will change you back into a mere human being. The werewolf form offers higher jumps, quicker speed, greater strength, a shockwave attack and the ability to climb walls, so naturally you'll want this form whenever possible.  Additionally the werewolf form has an anger meter that is augmented by collecting orbs. After 5 such orbs, the werewolf will transform yet again into a SUPER werewolf with even greater strength, speed and partial invincibility.

There are 5 stages in all. Each with a boss who moves in a distinct pattern.</desc>

The white lion ran away and found a shelter in a dark cave near the town. Some years later, Maria's parents organize an expedition to the cave in order to find out what the white lion really is. But they never come back...

Now Maria has to go to the cave and to search for her parents. equipped with the famous spear the brave soldier Moja used to defeat the lion, she receives the village elder's permission to descend into the cave. But while wandering through the dark corridors, she falls into a river, and a strong current brings her to the Dream World. She no longer can return back, and the fairies who inhabit the Dream World tell her that the only way to defeat the lion is to travel to yet another world - the Dark World...

In this game, you control Maria as she travels on the world maps, visits towns, and descends into dungeons. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from first-person perspective in Dragon Warrior style. Instead of party members you have ghosts you can summon to help you in battles, such as the soldier Moja and others. Hit points and magic points are called Courage and Dream, respectively. You gain levels only by finding special items, not from fighting random monsters.</desc>

From there, he is free to choose from among 6 different lands to explore: Fire test, ice ritual, secret cliff, water test, magic forest, and sacred woods. Each level is highly unique with its own dangerous enemies and lethal boss. After completing these 6 areas and collecting the associated totems, Soaring Eagle is whisked off to a cloud realm where he must use all of his accumulated power to defeat a much larger enemy.</desc>

While the game follows the movie's plot somewhat most of the time, it also expands on it and introduces characters, races and enemies not found in the movie.

Gameplay is similar to other action RPGs and The Legend of Zelda. Willow is seen from a top down perspective and all enemies are visible on screen. Slaying enemies will give Willow experience points, which will eventually lead to him increasing his stats automatically. New weapons, shields and magic items are found in various treasure chests scattered across the land or given to Willow as part of the plot. Aside from battling minor enemies Willow will also face off against several boss monsters as well as characters from the movie.</desc>

	<name>Willow [USA]</name>
	<desc>Willow is an action RPG based on the movie with the same name. The player assumes the role of Willow, the chosen one who must restore human form to the benevolent sorceress Fin Raziel and destroy the evil sorceress, Bavmorda. While the game follows the movie's plot somewhat most of the time, it also expands on it and introduces characters, races and enemies not found in the movie.

Gameplay is similar to other action RPGs and The Legend of Zelda. Willow is seen from a top down perspective and all enemies are visible on screen. Slaying enemies will give Willow experience points, which will eventually lead to him increasing his stats automatically. New weapons, shields and magic items are found in various treasure chests scattered across the land or given to Willow as part of the plot. Aside from battling minor enemies Willow will also face off against several boss monsters as well as characters from the movie.</desc>

	<name>Win, Lose or Draw [USA]</name>
	<desc>Win, Lose or Draw was a popular TV show requiring artistic skills and an ability to think laterally. A player on your team draws something on the big game board, and you must work out what it represents. They will be common expressions depicted literally, such as 'bright idea' showing a light bulb over somebody's head, and 'cabin fever' as a rickety building next to a man with a thermometer in his mouth. 

In this computerised implementation the drawing phase of the game is handled by the computer, so your task is simply to guess the meaning of the picture by thinking laterally. Your team has 60 seconds, and you can guess repeatedly, but the picture takes time to take shape. If you fail to guess correctly, the opposition has 15 seconds to guess it (with a single try) to steal the money.

	<desc>The first Wizardry game was one of the original CRPG dungeon crawlers, and stands along with  Ultima and  Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. You generate and control a party of up to six different adventurers and send them into a 3D vector dungeon to fight monsters and find treasure.

The game takes place in the domain of Trebor, the titular Mad Overlord. Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.

	<desc>The third installment of Wizards &amp; Warriors for the NES divulges during the intro that the evil wizard Malkil was not actually vanquished at the end of the second game. In fact, after the mighty battle with the hero Kuros, Malkil retreated to a nearby self-contained castle kingdom and conducted a hostile takeover. Kuros comes on the scene and must attempt to relieve Malkil of his ill-gotten command of the kingdom, its subjects, and especially its princesses.

The third game in the Wizards &amp; Warriors NES franchise features a similar feel to the first two games in that Kuros' movements are very quick and nimble. The player also has the ability to control Kuros' sword swing movements. However, Kuros has three different character classes to alternate between-- the knight, the thief, and the wizard. Each represents trade-offs between speed, attack strength, and defense strength. There are various guilds throughout the game devoted to training knights, thieves, and wizards where the player must complete challenging obstacle courses in order to increase their character class level.

The gameplay proceeds up a large vertical city/castle with dangerous, monster-filled hallways and caverns. Kuros must kill monsters, gather money, buy goods and services, raise his character class levels, rescue a variety of apprehended princesses and gather special jewels, all in a quest to face off with Malkil once again.

	<desc>Wonderland Dizzy For NES HERE AT LAST ? its only taken Codemasters (aherm) 20 years to get this bad boy developed and released, well technically NOT Codemasters?.
While the original game series, which included the first game, its sequels Treasure Island Dizzy and Fantasy World Dizzy, was developed by twins Andrew and Philip Oliver, future sequels came under the wings of Big Red Software. However, the lads didn't just stop with those three Dizzy games, they were also working on a fourth and final game by the name of Wonderland Dizzy which unfortunately was never released. This game was supposed to be released for NES in 1993.
Wonderland Dizzy was thought lost many years ago, but a presentation made by the Olivers during a retro gaming convention in Blackpool piqued the pair's curiosity over their lost Dizzy entry ? they presented a map from the game at the event, but realised they had no memory of creating it ? motivating Philip to search his house to jog his memory. ?We couldn't remember if it was a new game, whether it was finished and whether it would even run,?</desc>

	<desc>A boxing game from Romstar that has many similarities to Data East's Ring King. You can play a one player "Ranking" mode, where you can build your boxer's stats up while climbing the ladder to eventually challenge for a championship in one of the four weight classes. There is also a two player vs. mode where you and a friend can square off. A tournament mode allows up to 8 players participate in a bracketed tournament.

Gameplay consists of each boxer moving around the ring trying to land jabs, hooks, and uppercuts. The goal is to either knock your opponent out for a 10-count or have the most points on the scorecard at the end of the allotted amount of rounds.</desc>

	<desc>Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart.  A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>

	<path>/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/nes/Xexyz (USA).zip</path>
	<name>Xexyz [USA]</name>
	<desc>It's the year 2777. Due to nuclear wars and natural disasters, Earth's population has decreased dramatically and only five island are left, forming the nation of Xexyz. In Xexyz, humans, spirits and faeries have lived peacefully for centuries under the reign of King Xeu Star. One day, Xexyz is attacked by Goruza who murders the king, builds mechanical castles on each island and captures the queen of each island. You take on the role of a soldier named Apollo who wants to put an end to Goruza's reign.

Controlling Apollo, it is your task to free all five islands. Freeing an island is done in several different phases that feature 'Jump'n Shoot' as well as 'Shooter' levels (called "Action Mode" and "Shooting Mode"). The first level of each island is a Jump'n Shoot level that contains many doors to shops, bonus games, friendly NPCs or mid-bosses. NPCs will sometimes give you important hints, items or weapons; bonus games can be played to win some money ("Balls"); defeating mid-bosses (and thereby freeing a Fairy) will get you a cash reward and shops also offer weapons and items. Weapons differ largely in attack power and range. Items have temporary effects such as invincibility or improved jumping abilities. In an island's first level, you will have to find a secret room and defeat a boss, for which you will receive a Force Star that is needed to gain access to a mechanical castle. Mechanical castles look similar to other Jump'n Shoot levels but are more complex.

Once you have made your way to a "Cyborg Rider", a self-scrolling Shooter sequence starts in which you have to shoot your way through lots of enemies while picking up speed and weapon power-ups.
At the end of this sequence you will leave the Cyborg Rider, and step onto a floating platform for a boss fight. After the boss is defeated, another Shooter sequence with another boss at the end awaits, but this time, the boss if fought from the Cyborg Rider. After defeating this boss, you start the process over with a Jump'n Shoot level.</desc>

	<name>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles [USA]</name>
	<desc>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles is based on the television series of the same name, which is in turn based on the Lucas/Spielberg movie franchise starring Harrison Ford. In this game, a young Indiana Jones embarks on globetrotting adventures in which he gathers treasure and fights for what is good and right.

The game features side-scrolling action where young Indy trots along the ground, jumps, crawls flat, and can collect and wield a variety of weapons against copious enemies in the game. Indy starts with a whip and can find such weapons as throwing knives, grenades, pistols, rifles, and others. He can also collect hat powerups which allow him to sustain more damage.</desc>

	<name>Yousei Monogatari : Rod Land [Japan]</name>
	<desc>Taking a rather literal view of the term 'slap-stick humour', Rodland features two fairies called Tam and Rit, whose mission is to rescue their mum who's been captured and taken to a castle. 

There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.

When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.

Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.

In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.</desc>

	<name>Ys [Japan]</name>
	<desc>You are Adol (Aron in Sega Master System version) Christian, a red-haired adventurer and expert swordsman. One day you encounter a fortuneteller who sends you on a quest to find information about the six books of Ys. It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books. Before long you learn that the six books were all stolen by the evil wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in Sega Master System version, Malificus in PC version). It is your task to defeat the villain and to discover the secret of Ys!

Ys is an action RPG with original combat: instead of pressing the "attack" button, you simply run into the enemies you encounter. You do more damage if you run into them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in Adol's death if the monster is stronger than him. You gain gold and experience points for defeating your foes; once you have gained enough experience, you level up and become stronger. You can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.

	<name>Ys II : Ancient Ys Vanished, The Final Chapter [Japan]</name>
	<desc>This is the second game in the long-running Ys action RPG series. A bright light shot up from Dahm Tower in the end of the first game, and our hero Adol Christian is awakened by a young girl who finds him lying on the ground. She introduces herself as Lilia and tells Adol he is in the land of Ys. Finally he was able to establish a connection between his world and this mysterious land! But finding the gateway to Ys is not enough: Adol must stop the evil entity that his archenemy Dark Fact served. And his foes already know where he is...

This game is a direct sequel to what PC players know as  Ancient Land of Ys (of which the original NES version was simply called Ys), and is also the same game (story-wise) as the second part of Ys: Book I &amp; II for TurboGrafx CD. The gameplay utilizes an unusual action RPG combat style, where you don't press any attack button, but run into your enemies in order to cause damage. You should choose the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise you'll be dead. You can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade your weapons and inventory, like in any other RPG.

	<desc>Adol's long time friend, Dogi wishes to return to his home town of Redmont after hearing about strange disturbances that are happening there.  Always looking for an adventure, Adol joins him and soon finds out the cause of this new evil.

Ys III breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games and allows Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions.  As well as changing the battle system, the game is now side scrolling instead of the previous games top-down view. Adol also now has the ability to jump.  Not new to the series is the use of magical rings which give Adol different powering up abilities such as healing and shielding.  The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.

	<desc>ZANAC A.I. is a 2D shoot them up game. You are flying fighter model ZANAC, a ship built by 256 Riot Fleet as man's last hope against total annihilation. On board are special weapons to help you blast your way through twelve screens of enemy creatures and destroy the system's home base. Zanac is divided into 12 "areas", which look like planets. The various locations range from deserts to jungles and from oceans to industrial zones, featuring many different types of enemies.

Zanac's unique artificial intelligence program can intensify the action based upon your level of skill. The better you are, the more powerful "The System". Examples of the A.I. (but not limited to) in this game: the enemies are generally coming randomly with their behavior based on factors like the position your ship in the screen, the place you last died; the shoot speed of the enemies and bosses do also vary.

At the end of each area (level) you'll have to fight the area boss. Area bosses are mainly based around huge, screen-filling bunker bases consisting of gun turrets and a "core". You have limited time for fighting against the area boss - a time out could mean failure in entering the next stage, and with the time running, more and more enemies were attacking as penalty.

	<name>Zelda no Densetsu 1: The Hyrule Fantasy [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.

The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. 

Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. 

There are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. 

To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. 

If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the "2nd quest", which is essentially a harder version of the game. 

The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.</desc>

	<desc>Zen: Intergalactic Ninja, based on a comic book of the same name, is a story about a militant environmentalist ninja named Zen. He has been assigned by a group a green, pointy-headed aliens to come to earth and stop environmental pollution by any means necessary. Eventually, he will have to find the big polluter, Lord Contaminous. The gameplay consists of side scrolling and isometric 3D scrolling action. Zen can run, jump, slice with this stick, or use powerups as the game requires.

One stage has Zen planting time bombs in a toxic factory and attempting to escape within 99 seconds. Standing in his way are roving lasers, security robots, and floating conveyor belts. The second stage takes place in an acid rain-drenched forest. Zen must revive the flowers in the forest with his photon stick while beating off acid rain-spewing floating mechanical devices.

The next stage takes place on an off shore oil rig that is going up in flames. Zen must grab fire extinguisher powerups and rescue trapped rig workers while dodging sentient oil slicks and raining fireballs. Another stage is called the High Speed Railway stage. The goal is to stop the garbagemen spreading nuclear waste. Zen is in a mining cart racing underground and fighting other enemies in carts. Zen can make this cart jump, which we will have to do often in order to survive the dangers of the mine.

	<desc>Video round ball seems to come in a variety of court sizes and player numbers. All-Pro Basketball combines five-on-five full-court action with a half-court screen view.

All-Pro style B-ball features several different play options. Go head-to-head with a friend in a one-game contest. Or, watch two computer teams battle it out on court. If you choose league competition your task is to lead your team to the league championship. In Two Player league play you and a buddy team up to battle the computer teams. Choose your squad from eight professional rosters - ranging from the New York Slicks to the San Francisco Bayriders. Each team has their own strengths and weaknesses.

When the scene is set, the game begins with a jump ball and then it's non-stop no-holds-barred B-ball. On offense you're the team - running, jumping, jump passing, shooting, and even going for three pointers or slam dunks. On defense make a steal or grab a rebound. And remember this is real video basketball. You get called for fouls and your teammates get tired. When their health and stamina get low it's up to you to put them on the bench for a rest.

	<name>Zippy Race [Japan]</name>
	<desc>In a game reminiscent of both Road Fighter and Rally Bike, the player takes control of a motorcyclist who's in a race to be the first to traverse the United States from the west to the east coast, starting in Los Angeles and ending up in New York City.

Gameplay consists of the player dodging cars and other roadway hazards on their way to the next checkpoint. Players can either accelerate or hit the brakes on their motorcycle so they can avoid getting into an accident. Accidents cause the player to lose fuel and running out of fuel can end the game. So players must keep an eye out on the fuel gauge, which can be refilled by fuel barrels littered throughout each stage. Each car the player passes betters their ranks which increases their score.</desc>

	<name>Zombie Nation [USA]</name>
	<desc>In 1999 a mysterious object crashes into the desert and a mysterious creature, Darc Seed appears. Using magnetic powers, he soon turns the people of the United States into zombies and exerts influence over various weapons and objects. Among the weapons Darc Seed claims is the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi hears about this, he sets out for the United States to defeat Darc Seed and reclaim the sword.

What makes this so unusual however is that "great head of the samurai" is to be taken literally and Namakubi therefore is a giant disembodied head. His main weapon is the ability to shoot projectiles from his eyes and bombs from his mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks.

The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player can control Namakubi's movement across the screen and the ability to shoot. Enemies reduce health by varying amounts, health can be restored by increasing the player's score. The game features four distinct stages with 2 difficulty settings.</desc>
